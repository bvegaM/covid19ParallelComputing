We also detected viral RNA in serum among a subset of HCT recipients soon after transplantation with respiratory virus pneumonia caused by RSV, influenza virus, or MPV but not among patients with PIV or CoV pneumonia.

We did not have access to other specimens to evaluate for the presence or replication of virus in extrapulmonary sites. Pathogenic viral dissemination is just one possible mechanism to explain our findings. Alternative explanations include (1) physical release of intact viral particles into the circulation resulting from high viral loads in the respiratory tract that leads to epithelial cell death and (2) detection of virus or viral RNA from antigen-presenting cells, including pulmonary macrophages and dendritic cells, which gain direct access to the bloodstream during severe infection. It may be that detection of viral RNA in serum is typical in respiratory virus infections among HCT recipients and that use of sensitive RT-PCR assays enabled us to detect this occurrence. Further studies are necessary to investigate whether patients with upper respiratory tract infection alone or with disease that progresses from the upper to the lower respiratory tract may also have respiratory virus RNA detected in serum samples.",

            "text": "Implications of viral RNA detection in serum probably vary for different viruses. Studies of avian influenza virus suggest that detection of viral RNA in serum or plasma is a marker of disease severity and poor outcome [16, 17, 27]. Indeed, in avian influenza virus infection a viremic phase may contribute greatly to pathogenesis. Although we do not have definitive evidence of detection of replication-competent virus, we did find that detection of RNA in serum was associated with an increased risk of death. Among patients with RSV infection, high levels of RNA were detected in concomitant BAL samples at the time of RNA detection in serum samples, suggesting that the amount of infecting virus may influence the likelihood of serum RNA detection. This may indicate that we are detecting RNA that has spilled over because of pulmonary tissue damage. However, for the 2 patients with influenza virus detected in serum, the corresponding BAL viral load was considerably lower, suggesting detection of a true viremic phase. Clinically, complications of influenza include myocarditis and encephalopathy, although it is not clear whether these represent direct viral invasion or an aberrant host immune response [45\u201348]. These are important questions for investigation, because RT-PCR testing of serum for respiratory viruses may offer an adjunctive method for diagnosis of severe viral respiratory pneumonia and may have important implications for therapy and monitoring in certain patients. Further study is needed to determine whether viruses such as influenza virus and RSV have a true viremic phase associated with the detection of viral RNA in serum; if so, this may indicate that aerosolized therapy has limitations for some HCT recipients with viral pneumonia. Treatment with systemic antivirals may be beneficial for these patients.",

Our stored repository of BAL and serum samples, collected prospectively during the study period, provided a valuable opportunity to evaluate a large quantity of specimens. Importantly, all patients received a standardized diagnostic work-up for pneumonia, including bronchoscopy at the first clinical or radiographic indication of lower respiratory disease. Although detection of viral RNA alone does not ensure that replicating virus is present, nucleic acid detection in serum has been associated with transmission and/or disease severity for both RNA and DNA viruses [24, 27, 35, 38, 49, 50]. PCR testing is often used for prompt, sensitive diagnosis of pneumonia in patients with possible lower respiratory tract disease, particularly in the immunocompromised population. Furthermore, many transplant centers are moving toward molecularbased laboratory techniques for diagnosis of respiratory viruses, so PCR testing of serum may soon be widely available. Our infrequent sampling of serum may have even underestimated the frequency of detection of circulating RNA. More frequent and regular sampling, as well as cell-based assays performed at the time of pneumonia, may increase the frequency of detection of respiratory viral RNA, because others have reported respiratory viral RNA detection in whole blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples but not in serum samples [28, 30\u2013 32].",

Varying collection volumes for BAL samples may have influenced quantitative viral results, although we would not expect BAL dilution factors of 1\u20132-fold to cause major differences in viral load. In a previous study of quantitative testing in nasal wash samples in which collection volumes were recorded, uncorrected viral loads were compared with viral loads corrected by sample volume, and differences in samples were within the range of assay reproducibility (<0.5 log10 viral load) [7]. In this study, we assumed that 1 copy of viral RNA equals 1 virus particle for all viruses studied-that is, that we are detecting genomic RNA. We do not know the proportion of viral genomes that are infectious. If not all genomic copies in a specimen are infectious in vivo, quantifying viral RNA by PCR may overestimate the number of infectious particles. In addition, a small number of BAL samples tested negative by RT-PCR. At times, these samples were stored at -20\u00b0C, a temperature not optimal for longterm RNA storage. Thus, it is not surprising that degradation may have occurred and that viral RNA was undetectable in a few samples. We did not see a trend of decreasing quantitative viral load over time to suggest that duration of storage affected RNA amplification. Because we identified only 6 patients with viral RNA detected in concomitant serum samples, our ability to perform more rigorous multivariate analysis of outcomes was limited by sample size.",
