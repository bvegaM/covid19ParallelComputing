First, unlike other organs, the brain exhibits limited ultrastructurally well\u2010defined stromal space. Despite elegant descriptions by Camillo Golgi and Santiago Ramon y Cajal at the turn of the previous century, prior to the 1970s, it has been generally accepted that brain tissue consists predominantly of closely apposed neurons and glia, leaving little room for significant amounts of ECM. Several newer technologies have been used to gradually revise this theory to accommodate the presence of a variety of ECM molecules filling significant amounts of ECM space (93). Second, common ECM components of systemic organs (eg, fibronectin and collagen) are virtually absent from the adult brain ECM, while different types of proteoglycans are abundantly expressed in the adult brain and are localized to intercellular spaces between neurons and glia [For extensive review, see Yamaguchi (93), Dityatev and Schachner (31), and Bandtlow and Zimmermann (8).].",

PNNs are reticular networks observed on the surface of neuronal cell bodies and proximal dendrites (Figure 1). As the name implies, the ECM materials deposited in the space between neurons and astrocytic processes ensheath the neuronal cell surface with a netlike structure (Figure 1). While histologically bland in appearance, PNNs vary in character and distribution, each with a potentially unique molecular structure surrounding a wide variety of neurons (31). This structure includes lecticans, hyaluronic acid (HA), tenascin\u2010C and tenascin\u2010R. It is thought that the HA\u2013lecticans\u2013tenascin complex deposited on neuronal surfaces may form a repulsive barrier against approaching axons and dendrites. The absence of synaptic contacts along neuronal surfaces covered by PNN supports this hypothesis. Although the physiological role of PNNs has not been fully elucidated, their postnatal appearance suggests a role in limiting the development of new synaptic contacts (93).",

The diversity of proteoglycans in the ECM is dependent on differential expression of genes encoding core proteins, alternative splicing and transcription\u2013termination, as well as variations in the length and types of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains. Built around a core protein, polymers of 20\u2013200 disaccharide repeats are attached through serine residues. Classified on the basis of disaccharide composition, GAGs are grouped as chondroitin sulfate (CS)/dermatan sulfate (DS), heparan sulfate (HS) and keratan sulfate (KS). HA is a non\u2010sulfonated polymer of glucosamine and glucoronic acid, which exists as a protein\u2010free polysaccharide on cell surfaces and in the ECM (8). Chondroitin sulfate or HS side chains compose most central nervous system (CNS) proteoglycans; some of them are constituents of the ECM and others are bound to cell surfaces by a transmembrane domain or anchored with glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI). Proteoglycans can either promote or inhibit neuritic growth and possibly synaptic remodeling. Both the protein core and GAG side chains contribute to promoting or inhibiting neurite growth (Table 1) (8).",

            "text": "ECM capacity to bind growth factors via HS and CS modulates their interaction with the cell surface. In fact, the localization and biological activity of factors such as fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) depend strongly on the presence and composition of the ECM. Cells that express high\u2010affinity receptors but lack surface HS do not respond to these ligands (94). HSPG can stabilize FGF, protect it from proteolysis and serve as a co\u2010receptor influencing its interaction with cell surface high\u2010affinity receptors (Figure 2) 77, 91. Specific structural aspects, including sulfonation of HSPG, are required for the proper interaction of HSPG with FGF. Thus, the regulation of GAG biosynthesis and modification greatly influences the functions of HSPG. The differential binding characteristics of specific HS structures can potentiate or inhibit the biological activity of FGFs (8). Other growth factor families, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet\u2010derived growth factor (PDGF), are known to bind to heparin/HS, which can modulate their biological activities 66, 72. The interaction between chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) and growth factors has attracted less attention; however, recent evidence supports the ability of CS chains to bind growth factors and to modulate their cell signaling. Phosphacan binds basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and potentiates its mitogenic activity almost as effectively as heparin (59). Oversulfated CS type E (CS\u2010E) was shown to bind midkine, heparin\u2010binding growth\u2010associated molecule (HB\u2010GAM), bFGF, heparin\u2010binding epidermal growth factor, FGF10, FGF16 and FGF18 (28). Appican, the proteoglycan form of amyloid precursor protein, contains oversulfated CS\u2010E and is capable of interacting with midkine and HB\u2010GAM; however, not much is known about its effect on their biological activities (88).",

            "text": "The two major systems that modify the adult brain matrix are the serine protease tissue plasminogen activators (tPAs) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The MMPs are synthesized as proenzymes with removal of a propeptide as a prerequisite for activation. They are synchronously expressed with tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), which form tight complexes with the enzyme. Activation of MMPs can occur through plasmin generation by tPAs, thus functionally linking the two proteolytic systems. The tPAs are also secreted in a precursor form as single\u2010chain polypeptides and in vitro are converted by plasmin to active double\u2010chain forms. Regulation of tPA activity in the nervous system can occur at multiple levels: transcription, translation, secretion and inhibition by anti\u2010proteases. Despite high levels of tPA mRNA in the hippocampal CA1 region, protein and enzymatic assays show no evidence of tPA, suggesting stringent translational control (39). Synaptic signaling can release this control and can lead to tPA secretion. Inhibition of tPA activity is under tight control by a variety of serpin family anti\u2010proteases (eg, protease\u2010nexin 1, neuroserpin and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1) (39). Some tPA effects are plasminogen independent (eg, cleavage of NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) enhancement of N\u2010methyl\u2010D\u2010aspartic acid (NMDA)\u2010mediated intracellular calcium levels or binding of the low\u2010density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor\u2010related protein) and promote upregulation of MMP\u20109, degradation of the ECM resulting in synaptic plasticity or neuronal degeneration (55). The mechanisms of activation of tPAs and MMPs in vivo are still poorly understood. The detailed molecular biology and biochemistry of these enzyme systems have been extensively documented elsewhere 27, 34, 52, 63, 95, 96. For purposes of this review, these proteolytic and GAG\u2010degrading enzymes, such as heparanase and chondroitinase, are key components in modulating cellular interactions with ECM (eg, proteolytic cleavage of core proteins or degradation of GAG side chains). MMPs are generally secreted; however, they can be localized to cell surfaces by binding to cell adhesion molecules or cell surface proteoglycans and integrins or through transmembrane domains of membrane\u2010type MMPs. Another subgroup of metalloproteases is the A disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAMs) and A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS). ADAMs are membrane\u2010anchored enzymes that possess both proteolytic and adhesive activities. They are involved in shedding of cytokines, receptors and growth factors as well as adhesion to integrins. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1)\u2010converting enzyme or ADAM17 is the most characterized sheddase releasing TNF\u03b1 from the cell surface (16). ADAMTSs are secreted enzymes that are involved in the cleavage of ECM proteoglycans and in collagen processing (71). MMP secretion has been shown to contribute to the migration ability of monocytes as well as astrocyte motility 56, 62, 67, 69, 74, 82. MMPs can also be secreted by neurons, oligodendrocytes, microglia and endothelial cells (52). The MMP inhibitors (TIMPs) are expressed in neurons and astrocytes in the adult CNS (25). tPA is expressed both in neurons and microglial cells and is highly expressed in regions involved in learning and memory. The activity of tPA in neural tissue is correlated with neurite outgrowth, regeneration and migration, suggesting that it might be involved in neuronal plasticity (58).",

Antibodies against neuronal cell adhesion molecules (NCAMs) or removal of the associated carbohydrate polysialic acid prevents LTP, whereas bFGF enhances LTP in the dentate gyrus. Stabilization of LTP has been suppressed in an early phase of LTP by recombinant HB\u2010GAM, which is known to bind to HSPGs in hippocampal slice cultures. Soluble syndecan\u20103's potential to modulate cell matrix associated with synaptic plasticity has been demonstrated by its suppression of tetanus\u2010induced LTP after application to the CA1 area of hippocampal slice cultures. Synaptically localized syndecans may be involved in binding to certain growth factors, thereby potentiating their action on synaptic receptor kinases, leading to induction of cytoskeletal changes. The late temporal expression of syndecan\u20102 within developing synapses suggests a role more closely associated with dendritic spine maturation rather than with early spine formation. This proposed role is supported by experimental evidence that syndecan\u20102 overexpression in hippocampal neurons accelerates spine maturation without affecting the total number of synapses (8).",

HSPGs directly interact with AMPA receptors to affect their activity and possibly to stimulate their aggregation. Injection of heparin or removal of HS by heparinase inhibits LTP, showing that LTP is dependent on endogenous HSs. HSPGs in association with polysialylated forms of NCAM regulate synaptogenesis and LTP\u2010induced formation of perforated synapses (32).

The constellation of neuropathological changes associated with HIVE includes activated and infected macrophages, astrocytosis and neurodegeneration (18). As neurons are not infected by HIV, the etiology of neurodegeneration must be indirect. Current leading theories suggest that neurodegeneration results from neurotoxic viral or inflammatory factors. The ability of activated monocytes and macrophages to penetrate the ECM and to migrate to target tissues is dependent on ECM\u2010degrading proteins like MMPs and heparanase. This degradation of ECM components could result in disintegration of the structure that physically and physiologically supports neurons, and thus could lead to degeneration.",

Because lipofuscin is an intralysosomal pigment composed of cross\u2010linked proteins and lipids generated by iron\u2010catalyzed oxidative processes, the results suggest a neuroprotective function of PNNs against oxidative stress, and thus are potentially involved in neurodegeneration (61).

Age\u2010related progressive neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD, are characterized by changes in the expression of proteoglycans and association with protein aggregation and amyloidosis. It is not known whether protein aggregation or deposition is a primary event leading to those secondary events of proteoglycan expression or whether the two processes are interrelated. Alternatively, changes in proteoglycans are the primary event that triggers protein aggregation. These changes are accompanied by a secondary microglial activation. The role and timing of microglial activation relative to A\u03b2 deposition are controversial. The extent of microglial activation in A\u03b2 deposition has been hypothesized to be limited to the transition from diffuse to mature plaques, when amounts of A\u03b2 deposits and the degree of neuritic changes increase (78). As of now, no clear correlation between ECM breakdown and neuronal death is apparent. From the work of Bruckner et al, it seems that neurons surrounded by PNNs are spared from neurodegenerative changes in AD (17). Breakdown of the PNNs mostly around parvalbumin\u2010positive neurons without the actual loss of the neurons suggests a change in the neuronal environment that could affect their function or susceptibility to further insult.",
