The interaction of the human host with a wide variety of pathogens has been accompanied by genetic adaptations to spatially and temporally fluctuating selective pressures imposed by the infectious agents. Numerous studies have sought the genetic imprint of natural selection imposed by pathogen pressures in human genes involved in immune response or, more generally, in host-pathogen interactions (Vallender and Lahn 2004). For example, natural selection has acted on such genes as MHC, \u03b2-globin, G6PD, IL-2, IL-4, TNFSF5, the Duffy blood group genes, and CCR5 (Ohta 1991; Hughes et al. 1994; Flint et al. 1998; Hamblin and Di Rienzo 2000; Tishkoff et al. 2001; Bamshad et al. 2002; Sabeti et al. 2002; Verrelli et al. 2002). However, little is known about genetic variation of genes involved in direct recognition of pathogens, or pathogens\u2019 products, and virtually no studies have investigated the extent to which pathogens have exerted selective pressures on the innate immune system.",

Recognition of pathogens is mediated by phagocytic cells through germline-encoded receptors, known as \u201cpattern recognition receptors,\u201d which detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns that are characteristic products of microbial physiology (Kimbrell and Beutler 2001; Janeway and Medzhitov 2002). This initial interaction is then translated into a set of endogenous signals that ultimately lead to the induction of the adaptive immune response (Medzhitov and Janeway 1998b).",

            "text": "In recent years, the C-type lectin receptors have received much attention in the area of innate immunology, the results of which were novel functional insights into the primary interface between host and pathogens (Medzhitov 2001; Cook et al. 2003; Fujita et al. 2004; Geijtenbeek et al. 2004; McGreal et al. 2004). In this context, two prototypic members of the C-type lectin\u2013receptor family are particularly interesting, since they can act as both cell-adhesion receptors and pathogen-recognition receptors. These lectins include CD209 (DCSIGN: dendritic cell\u2013specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin [MIM 604672]) and its close relative CD209L (L-SIGN: liver/lymph node\u2013specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin [MIM 605872]) (Curtis et al. 1992; Geijtenbeek et al. 2000b, 2004; Soilleux et al. 2000; Pohlmann et al. 2001). These lectin-coding genes are located on chromosome 19p13.2-3, within an \u223c26-kb segment, and result from a duplication of an ancestral gene (Bashirova et al. 2003; Soilleux 2003). An additional characteristic of both CD209 and CD209L is the presence of a neck region, primarily made up of seven highly conserved 23-aa repeats, that separates the carbohydrate-recognition domain involved in pathogen binding from the transmembrane region. This neck region presents high nucleotide identity between repeats, both within each molecule and between CD209 and CD209L. It has been shown that this region plays a crucial role in the oligomerization and support of the carbohydrate-recognition domain; therefore, it influences the pathogen-binding properties of these two receptors (Soilleux et al. 2000, 2003; Feinberg et al. 2005). In regard to expression profiles, CD209 is expressed primarily on phagocytic cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, whereas CD209L expression is restricted to endothelial cells in liver and lymph nodes (Bashirova et al. 2001; Soilleux et al. 2001, 2002). As pathogen-recognition receptors, the two lectins have been shown to recognize a vast range of microbes, some of which are of major public health importance (Geijtenbeek et al. 2004). Indeed, CD209 captures bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Helicobacter pylori, and certain Klebsiela pneumonia strains; viruses such as HIV-1, Ebola virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis C virus, Dengue virus, and SARS-coronavirus; and parasites like Leishmania pifanoi and Schistosoma mansoni (Geijtenbeek et al. 2000a, 2003; Alvarez et al. 2002; Colmenares et al. 2002; Halary et al. 2002; Appelmelk et al. 2003; Lozach et al. 2003; Tailleux et al. 2003; Tassaneetrithep et al. 2003; Bergman et al. 2004; Marzi et al. 2004). With regard to CD209L, studies to date have shown an interaction with a variety of viruses, including HIV, hepatitis C, Ebola, and coronavirus, as well as with the parasite Schistosoma mansoni (Bashirova et al. 2001; Alvarez et al. 2002; Gardner et al. 2003; Jeffers et al. 2004; Van Liempt et al. 2004). In this context, the efficiency of the two lectins in pathogen recognition and subsequent processing may have important consequences for the quality of host immune responses and consequent pathogen control and/or clearance.",

            "text": "An important step forward in the understanding of human adaptation to pathogens and control of infectious diseases includes the description of quality and quantity of genetic variation in genes involved in host recognition of infectious agents. Given the direct interaction of CD209 and CD209L with a large variety of pathogens, the CD209/CD209L genomic region provides an excellent model system to illustrate the extent to which pathogens have exerted selective pressures on host immunity genes. An additional feature that makes these genes highly interesting in evolutionary studies is that they are likely to have been influenced by similar genomic forces (recombination, mutation rates, etc.) because of their close physical proximity (\u223c15 kb), high nucleotide (73%) and amino acid (77%) identity, and identical exon-intron organization (Soilleux 2003) (fig. 1). In addition, it has been proposed that gene duplication of immunity genes is a molecular strategy developed by the host to enlarge its defense potential (Ohno 1970; Trowsdale and Parham 2004). A number of immune-system gene families have evolved, by gene duplication followed by natural selection, to provide responses to a wider range of pathogens, with welldocumented examples in immunoglobulin and MHC genes (Hughes et al. 1994; Ota et al. 2000). In this context, duplicated genes in cis, like CD209 and CD209L, may have undergone differential selective pressures to enlarge the defense role of these lectins. To address these complex issues, we performed a sequence-based survey of the entire CD209/CD209L region in a panel of individuals of different ethnic origins. Here, we report evidence showing that these two closely related innate immunity genes have gone through completely different evolutionary processes that are reflected in their current patterns of diversity. In addition, our study provides novel insights into how pathogens have shaped the patterns of variability of immunity genes resulting from gene duplication.",

For CD209L, we sequenced a total of \u223c5.4 kb per individual, following the same approach used for CD209, with the exception of the neck region. That region was genotyped for its number of repeats, since it turned out to be highly polymorphic, which prevented the sequencing process. Genotyping was performed by a single PCR amplification followed by migration in 2% agarose gels. Human primers were used to both amplify and sequence the orthologous regions in chimpanzees. However, because of polymorphisms specific to the chimpanzee lineage, we could not obtain the entirety of the sequence. Thus, 4.9 kb (90% of the total) of the chimpanzee CD209 sequence were obtained, and 5.3 kb (98% of the total) of CD209L. Detailed information on primer sequences and PCR amplification conditions is available on request. All nucleotide sequences were obtained using the Big Dye terminator kit and the 3100 automated sequencer from Applied Biosystems. Sequence files and chromatograms were inspected using the GENALYS software (Takahashi et al. 2003; Centre National de Genotypage). As a measure of quality control, when new mutations were identified in primer binding regions, new primers were designed and sequence reactions were repeated, to avoid allele-specific amplification. All singletons observed in our data set were systematically reamplified and resequenced.",

Under the standard neutral model of a randomly mating population of constant size, these are unbiased estimators of the population mutation rate \u03b8=4Ne\u03bc, where Ne is the diploid effective population size and \u03bc is the mutation rate per generation per site. To test whether the frequency spectrum of mutations conformed to the expectations of this standard neutral model, we calculated Tajima\u2019s D (Tajima 1989) and Fay and Wu\u2019s H tests (Fay and Wu 2000). P values for the different tests were estimated from 104 coalescent simulations under an infinite-site model, with use of a fixed number of segregating sites and the assumption of no recombination, which has been shown to be a conservative assumption (Gilad et al. 2002). In parallel, we estimated P values for all these tests, using the empirical distribution obtained from sequencing data of 132 genes in a panel of 24 African Americans and 23 European Americans (Akey et al. 2004). All these analyses, together with the interspecies McDonald-Kreitman (McDonald and Kreitman 1991) and KA/KS (Kimura 1968) tests, were performed using the DnaSP package (Rozas et al. 2003). Genetic distances between populations (FST) and heterozygosity values were estimated using the Arlequin package (Schneider et al. 2000). FST statistical significance was assessed using 10,000 bootstrap replications. To bear out a deficit or an excess of heterozygosity in the neck region of CD209 and CD209L, we used BOTTLENECK (Cornuet and Luikart 1996) to compute for each geographic region, the distribution of the heterozygosity expected from the observed number of alleles, given the sample size (n) under the assumption of mutational-drift equilibrium. This distribution was obtained through simulation of the coalescent process of n genes under two mutational models, the infinite-site model and the stepwise mutation model. In addition, to obtain information on the fraction of genetic variance in the neck region that is due to intra- and interpopulation differences, we performed an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), using the Arlequin package (Schneider et al. 2000). The AMOVA results were compared with those of 377 microsatellites analyzed in the same population panel (Rosenberg et al. 2002).",

We applied the algorithm five times, using different randomly generated seeds, and consistent results were obtained across runs. After haplotype reconstruction, linkage disequilibrium (LD) between pairs of SNPs was computed using Lewontin\u2019s D\u2032 index (Lewontin 1964). For this analysis, only markers presenting a minimum allele frequency (MAF) of 10% were considered, since rare alleles have been shown to present a higher probability of being in significant LD than do common ones (Reich et al. 2001). The graphic display of the LD plots was constructed using GOLD (Abecasis and Cookson 2000; Center for Statistical Genetics). To support the existence of a recombination hotspot in the region under study, we used the hotspot-recombination model implemented in Phase (v.2.1.1). Under this model, we assumed that there was, at most, one hotspot of unknown position. We then estimated the background population-recombination rate (\u03c1) and the relative intensity of any recombination hotspot. To obtain better estimates, we increased 10 times the number of iterations of the final run of the algorithm. All our estimations were obtained by averaging results of five independent runs with use of different seed numbers. Since the model used is Bayesian, we could also estimate, for each population, the posterior probability of a hotspot of intensity >1 (\u03bb>1) and >10 (\u03bb>10).",

For CD209, we identified 42 different haplotypes, with an overall heterozygosity of 84% (table 2). Three major haplotypes (H2, H29, and H40) accounted for \u223c50% of the African variability, whereas they were at very low frequency (H2 at \u223c5%) or absent (H29 and H40) in Europeans and East Asians (fig. 2A). In turn, the two haplotypes (H1 and H3) that accounted for 58% and 83% of the European and East Asian variability, respectively, were observed at very low frequency (H1 at 6%) or even absent (H3) in Africa. However, H3, which had a frequency of 36% and 20% in Europe and East Asia, respectively, is just a one-step mutation (SNP 871) from H2, the most frequent haplotype in the African sample. The most interesting observation of the CD209 haplotype variability was the presence of a highly divergent haplotype cluster. This cluster, which contains haplotypes 40\u201342 (referred to here as \u201ccluster A\u201d), differs from all other haplotypes (referred to here as \u201ccluster B\u201d) by 35 fixed positions (fig. 2A). Cluster A is Africa specific and is present at a frequency of \u223c15%, whereas cluster B is present in the remaining African and all non-African samples. It is worth noting that three (SNPs 1839, 1888, and 1908) of the five nonsynonymous mutations identified for this gene are unique to cluster A. In all cases, these three mutations were segregating together, with the exception of one haplotype, H41, which does not contain the SNP 1839. Samples from cluster A are geographically widespread over the entire African continent (i.e., two San from Namibia, three Bantus from Gabon and two from South Africa, three Yorubans from Nigeria, and two Mandenka from Senegal). For CD209L, 74 different haplotypes were observed (fig. 2B), with an overall heterozygosity of 94% (table 2).

We estimated the posterior probabilities of a hotspot of any kind, Pr(\u03bb>1), and of at least 10 times the background recombination rate, Pr(\u03bb>10). Pr(\u03bb>1) was 100% for all population groups, and Pr(\u03bb>10) was 64% for Africans, 97% for Europeans, and 92% for East Asians. Thus, our data clearly indicate a relative increase of the recombination levels between the two genes, which suggests the occurrence of a hotspot of recombination, the magnitude of which varies among the major ethnic groups. However, our data do not include intergenic SNPs; therefore, the exact location and width of the recombination hotspot within the intergenic region remains unclear, since this observation would be consistent with either an intense narrow hotspot or a weaker but wider hotspot.",

A previous study has shown that the length of the neck region of CD209L varied between individuals of European descent (Bashirova et al. 2001). To investigate the degree of polymorphism of the neck region in both CD209 and CD209L, we genotyped it in the entire HGDP-CEPH panel (1,064 individuals from 52 worldwide populations). Striking differences were observed between the two genes (see fig. 5 and table 4 for detailed allele frequencies in each population). For CD209, virtually no variation was observed, and the 7-repeat allele accounted for 99% of the total variability. Despite this limited variation, eight different alleles were observed, with an allele size range of 2\u201310 repeats, not including a 9-repeat allele. The geographic region that presented the highest variability was the Middle East, with five of the eight different alleles observed (fig. 5A and table 4). For CD209L, a completely different pattern emerged, with strong variation in allelic frequencies of different repeat numbers. Of the seven alleles observed (from 4\u201310-repeat allele size classes), the three most common overall were the 7- (57.42%), the 5- (23.92%), and the 6- (11.37%) repeat alleles. European, Asian, and Pacific populations presented a mosaic composition of different allelic classes, whereas 7- and 6-repeat alleles accounted for most (96%) of the African diversity (fig. 5B). The strong difference in the neck-region lengths between the two genes was consequently visible in the heterozygosity values: CD209 exhibited an overall heterozygosity of only 2%, whereas CD209L presented a value of 54% (table 5). Our results showed that the levels of heterozygosity observed at CD209 were considerably lower than expected, regardless of the mutation model considered (i.e., Infinite Site or Stepwise Mutation Models) (table 5). In strong contrast, although not statistically significant for individual populations, CD209L exhibited a pattern of an excess of heterozygosity in all populations.",

Since this method assumes an infinite-site model without recombination, the same analysis for CD209L was not conducted because of the substantial amount of recombinant haplotypes observed. For CD209, only 29 of the 254 chromosomes analyzed had to be excluded, as did a single segregating site (SNP 939). The resulting CD209 gene tree estimate, rooted with the chimpanzee sequence (i.e., the chimpanzee sequence was used to define ancestral/derived status of human mutations), is shown in figure 6. The tree is partitioned into two deep branches that correspond to haplotype clusters A and B. African samples were observed in both sides of the deepest node of the tree (i.e., in both clusters A and B), whereas non-African samples are restricted to one branch of the tree (i.e., cluster B). The maximum-likelihood estimate of \u03b8 (\u03b8ML) for CD209 was 8.4. On the basis of this \u03b8ML value and the estimated mutation rate (1.54\u00d710-4 per gene per generation), the effective population size (Ne) was 13,636, a value comparable to most figures reported in the literature (for a review, see Tishkoff and Verrelli [2003]). The TMRCA of the CD209 tree was then estimated at 2.8\u00b10.22 MYA, one of the oldest TMRCA values estimated so far in the human genome (Excoffier 2002).",

            "text": "Our diversity study revealed completely different patterns for the two genes. First, levels of nucleotide diversity (\u03c0) were found to be much lower for CD209 than for CD209L (table 2). On the basis of 1.42 million SNPs, the International SNP Map Working Group defined 7.5\u00d710-4 as the average value of nucleotide diversity for the human genome and showed that 95% of all bins presented \u03c0 values varying from 2.0\u00d710-4 to 15.8\u00d710-4 (Sachidanandam et al. 2001). In addition, an independent study analyzed nucleotide and haplotype diversity for 313 genes and defined the average \u03c0 value as 5.4\u00d710-4 (Stephens et al. 2001). In this context, the values observed for CD209 (3\u20137\u00d710-4) are in agreement with these genome estimations, with the exception of the African sample, which showed extreme levels of diversity (26.0\u00d710-4) because of the presence of cluster A. By contrast, the \u03c0 values observed for CD209L (16\u201318\u00d710-4) are at least twofold higher than average genome estimates and fall into the upper limit of the 95% CI defined by the SNP Consortium (Sachidanandam et al. 2001). This contrast in nucleotide diversity between the two genes can be explained either by a disparity in local mutation rates or by actual differences in selective pressures. However, no major differences in mutation rates (1.57\u00d710-9 vs. 1.70\u00d710-9) were observed between the two homologues, nor was there substantial variation in GC content, which has been positively correlated with mutation rates and levels of polymorphisms (Sachidanandam et al. 2001; Smith et al. 2002; Waterston et al. 2002; Hellmann et al. 2003). Indeed, the GC content for CD209 (53.7%) was slightly higher than that observed for CD209L (50.9%), which reinforces the idea that different selective pressures may indeed have been the driving force behind the distinct patterns of diversity observed. Second, the patterns of repeat variation in the neck region also turned out to be strikingly different between the two genes. CD209 showed levels of heterozygosity of only 2%, whereas CD209L presented an extraordinarily high level of worldwide diversity, with an overall heterozygosity of 54% (table 5 and fig. 5). Although the neck regions of both genes share 92% of nucleotide identity, nonuniform mutation rates could, again, explain the patterns observed. However, this does not seem to be the case, since mutation-rate variation should influence the number of alleles observed rather than their frequencies, which are subject either to genetic drift or to natural selection. Indeed, we observed an even higher number of repeat alleles for CD209 (eight alleles) than for CD209L (seven alleles) (table 4 and fig. 5). Overall, differences in genomic forces seem to be insufficient to explain the contrasting patterns observed at both the sequence and neck-region length variation levels; therefore, the action of differential selective pressures acting on these genes becomes the most plausible scenario.",

For frequency-spectrum\u2013based tests, only Fay and Wu\u2019s H test detected an excess of highly frequently derived alleles for the African and East Asian samples, a picture that may be interpreted as the result of a selective sweep. However, the significantly negative value observed in Africa is, again, exclusively due to the presence of cluster A, since 22 of the 35 fixed SNPs distinguishing it from cluster B corresponded to the derived allelic status in the latter cluster. Because cluster B accounts for 85% of the African variability, a clear excess of frequently derived alleles was observed. The extent to which the presence of this cluster is due to either natural selection or population structure will be discussed in detail below. For East Asia, the significance of the H test is also questionable when accounting for the confounding effects of demography. Indeed, when we plotted our H value against the empirical distribution of 132 H values from non-African populations (Akey et al. 2004), the East Asian P value became nonsignificant (P=.36). This observation reinforces the idea that the H test is particularly sensitive to past bottlenecks and/or population subdivision (Przeworski 2002). Thus, regarding the global levels of sequence diversity, the CD209 locus seems to evolve under evolutionary neutrality. Nevertheless, when we focused our analyses at the protein level, signs of natural selection were uncovered. Indeed, the McDonald-Kreitman test rejected neutrality for this gene because of a clear excess of polymorphic synonymous sites (i.e., a lack of nonsynonymous variants). In addition, when the number of synonymous sites (146) versus nonsynonymous sites (499) was compared with the observed number of synonymous (5) versus nonsynonymous (0) mutations, we detected a significant lack of nonsynonymous mutations (two-tailed Fisher exact test, P=6.3\u00d710-4). These observations point to a strong selective constraint acting on CD209 that prevents the accumulation of amino acid replacements over time.",

            "text": "Further support for a functional constraint in CD209 comes from the patterns of diversity observed in the neck region. In contrast to CD209L, virtually no variation was observed at CD209 (fig. 5A), with the 7-repeat allele accounting for 99% of the total variability. Moreover, the low levels of heterozygosity observed resulted in a consistent rejection of mutation-drift equilibrium in almost all geographical regions (table 5). The probability of finding such a low heterozygosity value, given the overall number of alleles observed, was estimated to be <0.2%, independent of the mutational model considered (table 5). Thus, the fact that no alleles other than the 7-repeat allele have increased in frequency, together with recent studies addressing the functional consequences of repeat-number variation in this region (Bernhard et al. 2004; Feinberg et al. 2005), strongly suggests a clear reduced fitness of any allele other than the 7-repeat allele. Interestingly, it has been recently shown that a protein with two fewer repeats (a 5-repeat allele) results in a partial dissociation of the final tetramer, whereas a protein with <5 repeats exhibits a dramatic reduction in overall stability (Feinberg et al. 2005), with all these differences having a direct impact on the quality of ligand-binding functions (Bernhard et al. 2004). Taken together, the patterns of diversity observed at CD209 clearly point to a strong functional constraint acting on this gene and further support the proposed crucial role of this lectin in pathogen recognition and in the early steps of immune response (Geijtenbeek et al. 2000b, 2004).",

            "text": "In clear contrast to its homologue, CD209L presented extremely elevated nucleotide-diversity levels. High levels of diversity can result either from a relaxation of the functional constraint, which allows the stochastic accumulation of new mutations, or from the action of balancing selection, which maintains over time two or more functionally different alleles (and all linked variation) at intermediate frequencies. Several lines of evidence lend support to the selective hypothesis. First, if CD209L nucleotide diversity has been driven by the action of balancing selection, population-genetics relationships would have been accordingly altered. In this context, diversity studies in neutral, or assumedly neutral, regions of the genome\u2014such as the Y chromosome (Underhill et al. 2000; Hammer et al. 2001; Jobling and Tyler-Smith 2003), mtDNA (Wallace et al. 1999; Ingman et al. 2000; Mishmar et al. 2003), Alu insertions (Watkins et al. 2001), as well as some autosomal genes (Stephens et al. 2001; Akey et al. 2004)\u2014showed that African populations are genetically more diverse than are non-Africans, an observation generally interpreted as a support of the \u201cOut of Africa\u201d model for the origin of modern humans (Lewin 1987). For CD209L, even if we observed 1.5 times more segregating sites in African than in non-African populations, as indicated by the higher \u03b8w value found in Africa, similar values of nucleotide diversity were detected in the three groups, with Europeans presenting even higher \u03c0 values than do Africans. This unusual scenario, which is at odds with neutral expectations, has already been described for other regions of the genome, such as the \u03b2-globin gene and the 5\u2032 cis-regulatory region of CCR5, for which the action of balancing selection has been convincingly proposed (Harding et al. 1997; Bamshad et al. 2002). Second, balancing selection tends to increase within-population diversity while decreasing FST, compared with neutrally evolving loci (Cavalli-Sforza 1966; Harpending and Rogers 2000; Akey et al. 2002; Bamshad and Wooding 2003; Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman 2003). Indeed, our data are compatible with these predictions, since the 5% FST value observed for CD209L is threefold lower than that estimated for CD209 (15%) and is similar to that found, for example, for the bitter-taste receptor gene (5.6%), for which there is compelling evidence of balancing-selection action (Wooding et al. 2004). Third, results of our Tajima\u2019s D analysis were significantly positive for European and East Asian populations, because of the skew of CD209L frequency spectrum toward an excess of intermediate-frequency alleles (table 2), a pattern that further supports the action of balancing selection. However, since the null model used to assess significance makes unrealistic assumptions about past population demography (i.e., constant population sizes), the rejection of the standard neutral model cannot be interpreted as unambiguous evidence of selection. Indeed, the observation that only non-African populations showed a significant departure from neutrality raises the question of whether these patterns could have resulted instead from the bottleneck that occurred during the Out of Africa exodus. A way to circumvent this conundrum is to analytically integrate the fact that demography affects all the genome equally, whereas selection directs its effects toward specific loci. Thus, to correct for the confounding effects of demography, we plotted our results against the empirical distributions of Akey et al. (2004) for Tajima\u2019s D statistics. Our values remained significant for CD209L, which therefore reinforces the idea that the pattern observed is unlikely to be the sole result of demography.",

Since this domain is directly involved in pathogen recognition, neck-region length variation has important consequences for the pathogen-binding properties of these lectins (Mitchell et al. 2001; Bernhard et al. 2004; Feinberg et al. 2005). In perfect agreement with the results of our sequence-based data set, higher diversity in repeat variation was observed in the neck region among non-African populations (Native Americans excepted). Out of Africa, at least three alleles account for most population diversity, whereas, in Africa, the 6- and 7-repeat alleles alone account for 96% of the global variability (fig. 5B). Again, the higher diversity observed out of Africa could be due to a higher level of relaxation of the functional constraint of the neck region in non-African compared with African populations, which would lead to a random accumulation of proteins with varying neck-region lengths among non-Africans. Conversely, these patterns could also be explained by the action of balancing selection in non-Africans and could therefore point to the neck region as the functional target of such selective regime. To evaluate the plausibility of these two conflicting scenarios, we compared the variation in the CD209L neck region with that inferred from 377 neutral autosomal microsatellites typed elsewhere for the same population panel (Rosenberg et al. 2002). We reasoned that if CD209L diversity has been shaped only by demography (i.e., bottleneck out of Africa), the distribution of genetic variance at different hierarchical levels should be comparable to that inferred through the neutral markers. On the other hand, if selection has driven the CD209L neck-region diversity, population-genetics distances would be influenced accordingly and would therefore differ from neutral expectations. Indeed, the AMOVA values inferred for CD209L fell systematically outside the 95% CI defined for the microsatellite data set (table 6). We observed that populations within Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Oceania exhibited lower-than-expected diversity among populations within the same region. A reduction of genetic distances between populations is expected under balancing selection; therefore, the results from the CD209L neck region favor, once again, the action of this selective regime in most non-African populations, in detriment of the neutral hypothesis. One may argue that the differences in the proportions of genetic variance between our data and those of Rosenberg et al. (2002) could be due to differences in the pace of mutation between microsatellite loci and our neck repeated region that could be considered a \u201ccoding minisatellite.\u201d However, under neutrality, differences in mutation rate should have a similar and proportional effect in all population comparisons and should influence all values with a similar tendency (i.e., higher or lower values). Indeed, this is not the case: populations within Europe, the Middle East, Central/South Asia, East Asia, and Oceania turned out to be genetically closer than expected, whereas populations within Africa and the Americas exhibited the opposite pattern (table 6), which makes it highly unlikely that mutation-rate differences influenced our conclusions.",

A number of studies have already reported loci that present unusually deep coalescent times (Harris and Hey 1999; Zhao et al. 2000; Webster et al. 2003; Garrigan et al. 2005a, 2005b), but our estimation for CD209 remains one of the deepest TMRCA values yet reported (Excoffier 2002). The probability of finding such a deep coalescence time under a scenario of a random-mating population was estimated, through a coalescent process (Laval and Excoffier 2004), to be very low (P=.018) (see fig. 7). In addition to the unexpected antiquity of the CD209 locus, we observed a peculiar tree topology made of two highly divergent and frequency-unbalanced lineages, cluster A embracing only 2 internal haplotypes and cluster B comprising the remaining 23 (fig. 6).",

Indeed, the high levels of nucleotide identity between CD209 and CD209L could have led to gene conversion between the two genes, an event that would explain the outlier position of cluster A in the context of CD209 phylogeny. We reasoned that if gene conversion has occurred, we expect that the derived alleles distinguishing clusters A and B in CD209 would correspond to the allelic state observed in their homologous positions in CD209L. Of all positions, only four fit this criterion. In addition, these positions were not physically clustered, which therefore excludes a major gene-conversion event as the explanation of the divergent CD209 phylogeny.",

            "text": "Two other circumstances may be responsible for the topology and the time depth of the CD209 gene tree: long-standing balancing selection or ancient population structure, with Africa, in both cases, being the arena of such events (i.e., cluster A is restricted to Africa). Several lines of evidence argue against the balancing-selection hypothesis. First, under this selective regime, one would expect that Tajima\u2019s D test would also point in this direction by yielding significantly positive values, which is not the case (table 2). Second, such a long-standing balancing selection in Africa would have entailed a number of recombinant haplotypes between clusters A and B, which, again, is not the case, as illustrated by the high LD levels at CD209 (fig. 3). Third, a claim of balancing selection at this locus must imply a functional difference between the two balanced alleles. Indeed, three nonsynonymous mutations, situated in the neck region, separate cluster A and B, and they could correspond to the alleles under selection. But, if the neck region is the target of selection, it is more likely that the balanced alleles would correspond to different numbers of repeats rather than punctual nucleotide variation within each track, as observed for CD209L and suggested by functional studies (Bernhard et al. 2004; Feinberg et al. 2005). Since no variation in the number of repeats was detected between both clusters, we predict that there are no major functional differences between the two lineages. Taken together, maintenance of ancient lineages by balancing selection does not seem to be responsible for the observed haplotype divergence. In this view, the patterns observed are best explained by an ancestral population structure on the African continent. Indeed, several studies have already proposed that African populations must have been more strongly subdivided and isolated than non-African ones (Harris and Hey 1999; Labuda et al. 2000; Excoffier 2002; Goldstein and Chikhi 2002; Harding and McVean 2004; Satta and Takahata 2004; Garrigan et al. 2005a). In particular, a recent study of the Xp21.1 locus presented convincing statistical evidence that supports the hypothesis that our species does not descend from a single, historically panmictic population (Garrigan et al. 2005a). The divergent haplotype pattern observed at the Xp21.1 locus prompted those authors to explain their data under the isolation-and-admixture (IAA) model and/or a metapopulation model (Harding and McVean 2004; Wakeley 2004). Indeed, as observed for CD209, under an IAA model, the two basal branches are expected to be longer than those under a Wright-Fisher model, depending on the length of time subpopulations spent in isolation. The extent to which the IAA model fits the data depends on the number of mutations, referred as to \u201ccongruent sites,\u201d occurring in the two basal branches of the genealogy. For Xp21.1, 10 congruent sites over 24 polymorphisms were observed (i.e., \u223c42% of the total number of sites). We applied the same approach to CD209 and obtained a very similar percentage of \u223c45%, in good accordance with the IAA model. Our observations, together with a number of autosomal diversity studies, show that modern human diversity appears to have kept genetic traces of admixture among archaic hominid populations. However, a number of questions remain unanswered, such as the time when these admixture events occurred (i.e., before or after the appearance of anatomically modern humans), the precise quantitative contribution of ancient genetic material to our modern gene pool, and the geographic provenance of these genetic vestiges.",

In this context, one feature exploited by the host immunity genes to increase their defense potential is gene duplication by retention, through conservation of one duplicate, of the currently useful function of the encoded protein, while its twin is liberated to mutate and possibly acquire novel functions (Ohno 1970; Trowsdale and Parham 2004). The lectins CD209 and CD209L represent a prototypic model of a duplicated progeny of ancestral genes that interact with a vast spectrum of pathogens. Our results clearly indicate that these duplicated genes have evolved, and might still evolve, under completely different evolutionary pressures. Whereas one, CD209, shows signals of strong conservation, its paralogue, CD209L, exhibits an excess of sequence diversity compatible with the action of balancing selection. In addition, the strong contrast observed in length variation of the neck region between the two genes may have important consequences in medical genetics. In this context, association studies are now needed that correlate length variation of the neck region and susceptibility to infectious diseases whose etiological agents are known to interact with one (or both) of these lectins.",

The coming years will certainly bring unprecedented large data sets of sequence diversity, genomewide and populationwide, with each genomic region possibly revealing a different aspect of human history. The integration of all these apparently independent pieces of the same reality will provide us with a much broader and more realistic view of the demographic history of the human species, as well as of human adaptation to the different environmental conditions imposed not only by pathogens but also by other major factors such as climate and nutritional resources.",
