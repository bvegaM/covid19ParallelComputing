Just as national leaders have argued that the public should barter its civil liberties for safety from terrorist attacks, so public health officials have argued that health is best protected by adopting the national security metaphor; 2001 is the excuse, but 1918 is the model.",

Barry, the author of The Great Influenza, put it, \u201c[p]ublic health officials will need the authority to enforce decisions, including ruthless ones. \u2026officials might decide to order mandatory vaccination. Or, if there is any chance to limit the geographical spread of the disease, officials must have in place the legal power to take extreme quarantine measures\u201d in the case of a flu pandemic (Barry, 2004). If \u2018extreme' and \u2018ruthless' measures are seen as reasonable, no one should be surprised that the military is often immediately brought to mind. US President George W. Bush, for example, reacted to the threat of a bird flu pandemic in 2005 by suggesting that the US military should be used to quarantine \u201cparts of the country\u201d experiencing an \u201coutbreak\u201d (Annas, 2005a). And the federal government's new \u2018Draft Guidance on Allocating and Targeting Pandemic Influenza Vaccine', released in late October 2007, gives top priority to allocate vaccines in short supply, not to pregnant women, infants, children or the elderly, or even to front-line emergency medical care providers or outpatient health care providers, but to military personnel who have \u201can essential role in national and homeland security\u201d (http://www.pandemicflu.gov).",

However, he admitted that when the Japanese terrorist cult Aum Shinrikyo \u201cattempted to disperse aerosolized botulinum toxin both in Tokyo and at several military installations in Japan,\u201d the result was not millions dead, nor even hundreds, but rather, that all of these attacks \u201cfailed to kill anyone\u201d (Gostin, 2003). Similarly, others have asserted that the release of 100 kilograms of aerosolized anthrax over Washington could kill up to three million people. The real anthrax attacks through the US mail in late 2001 were highly effective in sowing terror, but resulted in only five deaths\u2014incidentally the same as the number of patients who die owing to medical errors in US hospitals every 30 minutes (Annas, 2003; Siegel, 2005).",

The information provided to physicians and nurses was in the same spirit as the information on the Iraq nuclear threat, except that it contained no facts at all, not even misleading or false ones. The one percent doctrine had become a \u2018more-than-zero' percent doctrine. Julie Gerberding, the Director of the CDC and the person in charge of the smallpox vaccination programme, told a US Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on 29 January 2003\u2014about one month after the smallpox vaccination campaign began\u2014that \u201cour reading of the intelligence that we share with the intelligence community is that there is a real possibility of a smallpox attack from either nations that are likely to be harboring the virus or from individual entities, such as terrorist cells that could have access to the virus.

Not only is this patently absurd, but it also often gets public policy and public health policy backwards. There should be no \u2018state secrets' in public health. For example, if the US Government knows that an individual, group or nation is working to weaponize smallpox, the best defence is to make this information public. As most Americans probably know this, the failure of the administration to offer any evidence of anyone having weaponized smallpox meant that it was highly probable that the administration had no such evidence. Thus the real risks of the vaccine could not be offset by any real benefit. The bottom line is that, although the potential risk for biological terrorism is greater than zero, it is still very low, and in almost any foreseeable attack the number of deaths is likely to be low. In fact, the only biological attacks to date have resulted in death tolls of between zero and five people\u2014hardly numbers that justify military intervention or the erosion of civil liberties.",

In the words of Gerberding, \u201c[a] threat anywhere is a threat everywhere\u201d (Kranz Lewis, 2006). There is no more powerful an illustration of the wrong-headedness of this approach than the government's inability to handle a real emergency, such as the humanitarian disaster that followed hurricane Katrina. The person in charge of the federal emergency response to Katrina, Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff, was simply not paying attention to the hurricane disaster. Instead, he was at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta making preparations for a possible bird flu pandemic. The abject failure to respond effectively to help the victims of hurricane Katrina illustrates that our \u2018all-hazards' at all locations approach, combined with a one percent doctrine, has produced two very real interrelated epidemics in the USA today: epidemics of fear and incompetence.",

Nonetheless, when health authorities determined that he had extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) they contacted him in Rome, telling him to go to an Italian hospital for treatment. When he did not do so, they treated him as a bioterrorist and put him on the \u2018no fly' list, issuing the first federal mandatory isolation order in the past 40 years. The order was enforced when Speaker and his wife returned to the USA and voluntarily reported to a New York City hospital. In fact, this measure was entirely unnecessary because Speaker had come seeking treatment voluntarily. The order seems to have been issued and enforced primarily to make Speaker look like the bad guy and the CDC look like the good guys\u2014by showing the public that it was doing something, however coercive and ineffective.By using this mode of fear-driven paranoia, the threat of bioterrorism has been hyped beyond all reality, even within the public health community, which should know better",

In a letter to David Walker, Comptroller General of the US Government Accountability Office, US Senators Joseph Lieberman, Susan Collins and Hillary Clinton stated that the case \u201cexposed a disturbing picture of the federal government's ability to respond to a known public health incident and protect our homeland security\u201d (Lieberman, 2007). Henry M. Blumberg, a TB expert at Emory University (Atlanta, GA, USA), said that, \u201cTB is a weapon of mass destruction\u201d (Brown, 2007). In reality, Speaker seems to have put no one in danger\u2014including his wife\u2014and the diagnosis turned out to be wrong anyway: he actually had multi-drug resistant (MDR)-TB. The correct lesson from the Speaker case is not that we need more draconian laws to isolate TB patients\u2014although such new laws have been proposed and are widely supported\u2014but that we need better TB diagnostic tests, better treatments and better communication with patients. Gerberding did, nonetheless, distinguish between Speaker and a real terrorist in testimony before the US Congress: \u201cThere is a difference between a terrorist and an infected person.

It is not only liberty that is at stake when deciding about quarantine, but also the very effectiveness of public health itself.

Nonetheless, as the epidemic ended abruptly in all 30 countries that had reported suspected cases, and only a few countries even attempted mass quarantine, it seems reasonable to conclude that quarantining contacts or even close contacts was unnecessary and had little or no effect on the epidemic. Moreover, the imposition of quarantine, in at least some cases, led to panic that could have further spread the disease, for example, in China. When rumours appeared that Beijing itself might be placed under martial law, the China News Service reported that 245,000 migrant workers from Henan province fled the city to return home (Hutzler, 2003). Even in Hong Kong's Amory Gardens, the site of the initial cluster of SARS cases, officials who came to relocate residents to a quarantine facility found no one at home in more than half of the complex's 264 apartments. People were able to evade the police even though the police were working closely with public health officials.",
