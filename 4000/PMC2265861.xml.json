It is an important infectious disease agent in pigs worldwide, causing reproductive failure in pregnant sows and respiratory problems in young piglets. In vivo, PRRSV replicates primarily in alveolar macrophages but has also been shown to replicate in blood monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages in vitro.1 The course of infection includes an acute viraemic stage, lasting approximately 1 month, followed by a chronic stage in which viraemia resolves, but virus can still be isolated from secondary lymphoid tissues.2 Virus has been reported to persist in some animals for months, with and without shedding.3,4",

Viral stimulation, independent of interferon signalling, can also stimulate the expression of various anti-viral proteins through the activation of Toll-like receptors (TLR) and other undescribed signalling pathways.17 PKR, Mx and other anti-viral proteins function to hinder viral replication by blocking protein translation or altering cell signalling.18 Once produced, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 can induce dendritic cell (DC) maturation19 and act as a survival factor for activated T cells.20,21 DC maturation in response to double-stranded RNA or viral infection requires IFN-\u03b1/\u03b222 and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 stimulates resistance in DCs to viral cytopathic effects.23 Several DNA and RNA viruses are capable of infecting DCs and have adapted mechanisms to modulate the host response.24 These studies, and others, indicate an important role for IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 during an immune response.",

Studies are needed to investigate the innate response of DCs to PRRSV as well as to identify ways in which the virus can interfere with host defences. This is important for understanding PRRSV-induced pathogenesis and for the development of protective vaccines. Evidence, as discussed previously, suggests that the early adaptive immune response to PRRSV is suboptimal and we hypothesize that this is due to the lack of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production by DCs after infection. Thus, the following study investigated the susceptibility of MDDCs and L-DCs to PRRSV, assessed type I interferon activation after infection and investigated the protective effects of IFN-\u03b1 on both DC populations.",

Peripheral blood was drawn from the cranial vena cava and animals were subsequently euthanized with an overdose of pentobarbital given intravenously. The pulmonary vasculature was flushed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove peripheral blood. This was accomplished by exposing the thoracic viscera and clamping the trachea and double-clamping the oesophagus and caudal vena cava before severing to avoid gross contamination of the lung. The pulmonary artery was clamped, a cannula was inserted distal to the clamp, and the vasculature was flushed with 300 ml of sterile PBS that was allowed to drain through the severed aorta. The lungs were subsequently removed and the airways were lavaged with 200 ml of sterile PBS to eliminate cells in the airways. Lung lobes were detached from the bronchi and trachea and submerged in sterile PBS until further processing.",

Of note, phenotypic analysis suggests that the L-DC population may contain immature (MHCdim/neg, CD80/86dim) and mature (MHChi, CD80/86hi) cells. However, L-DCs displayed functional characteristics (dextran and ovalbumin uptake) of immature DCs.

In addition, CD80/86 expression increased in the majority of polyIC-stimulated cells but did not change in PRRSV-treated cells. On the other hand, SIV did not alter MHC-I or CD80/86 expression.

Virus recognition between these two cell types may have occurred through different, but overlapping, mechanisms that resulted in differential IFN-\u03b2 transcription. Virus can be detected by the specific interaction of envelope glycoproteins with host cell-surface expressed receptors and/or detection of viral genome by endosomal TLRs22 and it has been shown that the induction of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production after viral stimulation is independent of replication.41 It is likely that L-DCs and MDDCs responded to PRRSV with IFN-\u03b2 transcription prior to virus replication, but the response in MDDCs was sustained due to the additional recognition of replication intermediates, such as double-stranded RNA. However, it is also possible that the variation in IFN-\u03b2 transcription between cells types is due to inherent differences between MDDCs and L-DCs. It has been shown that MARC-145 cells, a monkey kidney cell line, do not transcribe IFN-\u03b2 in response to PRRSV,42 which differs from results presented here.

Type I interferon is often referred to as IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 because both IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 signal through the same receptor (IFNAR). IFN-\u03b2 transcription is typically induced after viral stimulation and IFN-\u03b2 protein is released and signals in an autocrine/paracrine manner for IFN-\u03b1 transcription, as well as the transcription of other interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs).43,44 The observation that IFN-\u03b2 mRNA was not translated is supported by the observation that when MDDCs were stimulated with recombinant porcine IFN-\u03b1 or recombinant human IFN-\u03b21 (data not shown), levels of PKR and Mx mRNA increased. A lack of IFN-\u03b2 translation has been described in murine alveolar macrophages after TLR activation, in which IFN-\u03b2 transcription was induced but protein was not synthesized or secreted.45 This is supported by the observation the L-DCs stimulated with polyIC did increase IFN-\u03b2 transcription, but neither Mx-1 nor PKR transcription changed. Due to the limited availability of reagents for porcine IFN-\u03b2 we did not analyse IFN-\u03b2 protein levels.

PRRSV alone did not induce the transcription of Mx or PKR, but instead the addition of rpIFN-\u03b1 was required. The difference in the sensitivity of these two cell types to IFN-\u03b1 may be due to differential expression of IFNAR between MDDCs and L-DCs. Also, signalling proteins that propagate the IFNAR signal may be expressed at different levels between cell types and this may account for the difference in Mx and PKR transcribed after the addition of exogenous IFN-\u03b1. Overall, the type I interferon response to virus in both cell types was limited to IFN-\u03b2 transcription, and this is probably not enough to induce an anti-viral immune response in DCs during PRRSV infection.",

PRRSV did not replicate in L-DCs, indicated by the observation that the quantity of extracellular viable virus or vRNA did not change over time. However, when L-DCs were treated with rpIFN-\u03b1, extracellular amounts of viable virus decreased but vRNA levels did not. It is possible that the addition of rpIFN-\u03b1 to L-DCs induced the expression of an antimicrobial peptide that was able to alter the integrity of live PRRSV because viable virus in the supernatant decreased over time, but the amount of vRNA did not. Antimicrobial peptides, including defensins and cathelicidins, are expressed by various mammalian cells and have been shown to have a role in innate host defence.46,47 Antimicrobial peptides are able to insert into membrane bilayers, form pores and consequently compromise micro-organism structure.48 A recent paper shows that surfactant protein D can bind HIV and inhibit virus replication.49 Expression of some antimicrobial peptides is constitutive, whereas others are produced in response to proinflammatory cytokines.50 Overall, IFN-\u03b1 may induce L-DCs to produce an antimicrobial peptide that is capable of affecting PRRSV viability.",

These data suggest that DCs can respond to IFN-\u03b1, but are probably not a major source of the cytokine after PRRSV exposure. L-DCs stimulated with polyIC did increase IFN-\u03b2 mRNA transcription, but only a minimal change in IFN-\u03b1 transcription at 12 hr was observed, supporting the observation that L-DCs may not produce substantial quantities of IFN-\u03b1 but can respond to exogenous IFN-\u03b1. In addition, L-DCs stimulated with swine influenza virus (SIV) or porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) did not result in any change in IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b1, Mx-1 or PKR mRNA transcription at 12 or 24 hr (data not shown).

Taken together, these studies indicate that little IFN-\u03b1 is produced in the lungs of PRRSV infected pigs, although the presence of type I interferon would probably enhance the anti-viral response.

PRRSV stimulated IFN-\u03b2 transcription in both DC types, but was of greater magnitude and duration in MDDCs. Although IFN-\u03b2 transcription was stimulated, the usual type I interferon response to virus did not occur. PRRSV reduced MHC-I expression on L-DCs and the presence or rpIFN-\u03b1 could reverse this effect and actually enhance MHC-I and CD80/86 expression. These results indicate that DCs may respond inadequately to PRRSV, leading to a suboptimal initiation of the adaptive immune response. Exogenous type I interferon may be required to induce an effective anti-viral immune response during PRRSV infection. Further studies are warranted to determine the protective benefits of IFN-\u03b1 during PRRSV infection and its potential as a therapeutic intervention during severe disease outbreaks.",
