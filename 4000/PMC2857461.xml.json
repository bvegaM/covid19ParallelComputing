The primary phenotype of ADPKD is the progressive development in both kidneys of multiple fluid-filled cysts, which eventually result in end-stage renal failure (Gabow, 1990; Calvet and Grantham, 2001; Ong and Harris, 2005). Mutations in two causative genes, PKD1 and PKD2, encoding polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), respectively, can initiate cyst formation after homozygous loss-of-function mutations (Mochizuki et al, 1996; Harris, 1999; Wu and Somlo, 2000).",

On the basis of its predicted structure and functional features, PC1 is postulated to be a plasma membrane (PM) receptor involved in cell\u2013cell/matrix interaction and the regulation of several signalling pathways linked to cell proliferation (Arnould et al, 1998; Kim et al, 1999; Bhunia et al, 2002; Parnell et al, 2002; Delmas et al, 2002a; Streets et al, 2009). PC2, also called TRPP2, is smaller (968 amino acids) with six transmembrane spans, a pore forming region, and cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal tails. By virtue of its structural homology, PC2 belongs to the transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily of ion channels, which broadly function as cellular sensors for multiple stimuli (Mochizuki et al, 1996; Giamarchi et al, 2006; Damann et al, 2008).",

Among other PC2-interacting proteins described so far, \u03b1-actinin, fibrocystin and diaphanous-related formin 1 protein (mDia1) have been shown to regulate PC2 channel activity (Li et al, 2006; Wu et al, 2006; Bai et al, 2008b). Recent data also provided compelling evidence that PC2 heteromerizes with TRPC1 (Tsiokas et al, 1999; Bai et al, 2008a; Zhang et al, 2009) and TRPV4 (K\u00f6ttgen et al, 2008) to form channels with distinct properties from homomers. PC2 has also been shown to be expressed in mouse embryonic nodal cells, in the absence of PC1, where it is implicated in the determination of left-to-right asymmetry (Pennekamp et al, 2002; McGrath et al, 2003, Karcher et al, 2005). Overall, these observations show that PC2 exerts PC1-dependent as well as -independent functions and raise the question as to the mechanisms that direct assembly of PC2 into homomeric and heteromeric complexes.",

The specificity of this interaction is therefore a key regulatory step in the formation of PC1/PC2 ion channel complexes.

Y2H assays were performed using the C-terminus (CT2, aa680\u2013968) of PC2 or its truncations to delineate the minimal interacting regions for homodimerization (Figure 2A). Truncation of CT2 to E871 (680\u2013871) showed a stronger interaction with full-length CT2, activating ADE2 reporter. This is compatible with an inhibitory domain in the distal half of CT2 (872\u2013968) and/or a conformational change induced by deletion of the distal sequence (see NMR spectra). The minimal interacting region for CT2 self-association was 833\u2013871 (Figure 2A). Consistent with this, the peptide 680\u2013798, which includes CC1 but excludes CC2, was unable to interact with CT2. Furthermore, disruption of CC2 by mutations of key hydrophobic residues (V846, I853, I860 and L867; we will call this mutant CT2-4M) to alanine abolished CT2/CT2 interaction. In contrast, missense changes in CT2 at R807Q (likely polymorphism) (Rossetti et al, 2007) and S812A (a CK2 phosphorylation site) (K\u00f6ttgen and Walz, 2005) had little effect on CT2/CT2 binding.

For unknown reasons, we could not purify GST-(833\u2013871) from bacterial lysates using glutathione beads so this region could not be tested. Nevertheless, the introduction of CC2 mutations into Thio-CT2 (CT2-4M) completely abolished its ability to bind to GST-(799\u2013871) and GST-CT2 (Supplementary Figure 1A). In addition, we substituted the hydrophobic residue M849 in full-length PC2 with the hydrophilic residue proline, and assessed the mutational effect on its interaction with CD8-CT2. CD8-CT2 immunoprecipitated wild-type PC2 but failed to immunoprecipitate PC2-M849P and PC2-4M (Supplementary Figure 1B). Similarly, a CD8-CT2 deletion mutant (CD8-679\u2013824), lacking CC2, could no longer bind to full-length PC2 (Supplementary Figure 1B).

Absorbance (A280 nm) and interference data from three scans (0.4\u20130.6 mg/ml) were analysed using different parts of the curves. The molecular weight of the major peak for His-CT2 was estimated as a single species at 69.9 kDa. As the calculated molecular weight of His-CT2 is 35 kDa, this species likely represents CT2 dimers. A small broad peak (0.25 molar ratio; 166.6\u00b121.2 kDa) was also noted. These two peaks likely correspond to the 4.32 s (major) and 9 s (minor) peaks seen by sedimentation velocity (left panel in Figure 2B). The best fit to the data was obtained from a model predicting a major dimer species with a minor peak of higher MW material (contaminants and a possible tetramer). Of interest, the estimated frictional ratio (f/f0) was 1.5 (His-CT2) and 2.19 (His-CT2-4M), respectively. Assuming that the major peak for each protein represents dimers and monomers, respectively, this suggests that dimerization results in a more compact structure than monomers.",

In most cells, PC2 localized in concentric patches (called whorls), which were dispersed around the nucleus throughout the cytosol (Figure 3A), and in elongated loops adjacent to the outer nuclear envelope, which we will refer below as karmellae (Figure 3B) (Wright et al, 1990). Accumulation of PC2 in karmellae and whorls was observed after transfection in a variety of cell types, including CHO, COS-7 and MDCK cells (Supplementary Figures 2C and 3A). Within whorls, PC2 co-distributed with typical ER-resident proteins including calnexin, protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) and KDEL (Figure 3C), consistent with these structures being of ER origin. Neither the Golgi apparatus markers, Golgin-97, GM130 and \u03b2COP nor the endosomal or lysosomal markers (EEA1, rab7, LAMP1), were detected in PC2-labelled structures (Figure 3D; Supplementary Figure 3B and data not shown).

Deletion of CT2 distal to CC2 (PC2-R872X) had no effects on whorls formation, whereas deletion of CC2 (CD8-679\u2013824) prevented the formation of stacked pairs of ER membranes (Figure 3I and J).

The 2D 1H 15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectrum of CT2 shows poor chemical shift dispersion and a mixture of sharp and broad signals with far fewer signals than would be expected for a 288-residue protein (Supplementary Figure 6B). Mutation of CC2 (CT2-4M) only gave a slightly sharper NMR spectrum implying that most of the conformational exchange occurs as a result of a weak intramolecular rather than an intermolecular-binding event. This possibility is supported by the observation that the broadening is not dependent on the concentration of CT2 protein (data not shown).",

Cells co-expressing full-length PC2 and PC1 displayed a standing inward current with a mean amplitude of \u22123.5\u00b10.45 pA/pF at \u221260 mV, which was inhibited by amiloride (100 \u03bcM), a typical but unspecific blocker of PC2 channels (Figure 5B) (Delmas et al, 2004; Bai et al, 2008a). This current had a reversal potential of \u22121\u00b12 mV (n=7), typical of PC2. Combined visualization of PC2 and PC1 revealed multiple areas of co-localization of the two proteins at the cell surface (Supplementary Figure 7A). Amiloride-sensitive current was not detected in mock cells (expressing E-GFP, not shown) or cells expressing PC1 or PC2 alone (Figure 5A). To provide additional evidence that amiloride-sensitive current was carried by PC2, recordings were made in cells co-expressing PC1 and the channel-dead mutant PC2-D511V (Figure 5C). Mutations in PC1 (P4209X and R4227X) that truncated the coiled-coil domain in CT1 and abolished PC2 interaction occluded amiloride-sensitive currents (Figure 5D and J), although both PC1 mutants remained targeted to the PM (not shown, see Delmas et al, 2004). We next tested whether disruption of CC2 would abolish PC1/PC2 currents. None of the cells expressing the CC2 mutants together with full-length PC1 exhibited amiloride-sensitive currents (Figure 5E\u2013G). In addition, the pathogenic mutation (PC2-R845X) produced no currents when co-expressed with PC1 (Figure 5H and J). S812A mutation within PC2 did not abolish amiloride-sensitive PC1/PC2 current (Figure 5I and J).",

To test this possibility, we measured intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in patch-clamped sympathetic cells in response to application of MR3, which functions as a PC1 activating antibody (Delmas et al, 2004; Bai et al, 2008a). In cells co-expressing PC1 and PC2, MR3 produced a large increase in cytosolic Ca2+ (\u0394[Ca2+]i=372\u00b135 nM) that declined slowly with a time constant of 2\u20138 min (Figure 6A and C). These Ca2+ responses were absent in cells expressing PC2 or PC1 alone (Figure 6A and C). Although the rise in Ca2+ was reduced on switching to a Ca2+-free solution, MR3 still produced a significant rise in cytosolic Ca2+ when applied in a Ca2+-free solution (\u0394[Ca2+]i=92\u00b19 nM) (Figure 6B and C), implying mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Neither PC1/PC2-D511V-, PC1-P4209X/PC2- nor PC1/PC2-R824X-expressing cells responded to MR3 challenge (Figure 6B and C), indicating that integral PC1 and CC2-containing PC2 are required for MR3 mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. In addition, prior depletion of ER Ca2+ stores using the ER Ca2+-pump inhibitor thapsigargin (500 nM), fully prevented Ca2+ release in response to MR3 in PC1/PC2-expressing cells (Figure 6D).",

ATP-mediated Ca2+ transients had significantly (P<0.01) higher amplitudes in cells expressing PC2-M849P (\u0394 ratio, 0.44\u00b10.06) and PC2-4M (\u0394 ratio, 0.39\u00b10.03) compared with mock-transfected cells (\u0394 ratio, 0.21\u00b10.03), suggesting that PC2 with disrupted CC2 can form functional Ca2+-release channels. ATP responses had identical amplitude in the absence of external Ca2+, showing that the release of Ca2+ derives from intracellular stores (Supplementary Figure 8). In addition, PC2 activation by ATP appeared downstream to InsP3 receptors because it was prevented by 2-APB (100 \u03bcM) (Supplementary Figure 8).",

Here, we have identified and functionally characterized a coiled-coil domain that is critical for CT2 dimerization and binding to PC1 but not for assembly of homomeric PC2 channels. This C-terminal dimerization domain of PC2 therefore acts as a molecular signature for PC1 recognition and thus specifies the formation of multimeric PC1/PC2 complexes.",

            "text": "Using a coiled-coil prediction algorithm, we identified a stretch of residues extending from S835 to A873 (CC2) that exhibits a strong probability for coiled-coil formation. This domain, which has also been reported recently by others (Celic et al, 2008; Yu et al, 2009), is distal to the previously identified coiled-coil domain (E772\u2013L796) named here CC1 (Tsiokas et al, 1997). Coiled-coil domains critical for channel assembly have been identified in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tails of a number of ion channels, including Kv7 channels (Schmitt et al, 2000; Schwake et al, 2003), ether-\u00e0-go-go K+ channels (Ludwig et al, 1997; Jenke et al, 2003) and TRP channels (Tsuruda et al, 2006; Phelps and Gaudet, 2007; Fujiwara and Minor, 2008). Although it is clear that CC2 is an assembly domain, it does not seem to have a prominent function in the self-association of full-length PC2 but rather fosters formation of heteromeric PC1/PC2 complex. We found that PC2 channels with CC2 deletions tetramerize, localize properly in the ER and are not inactive, indicating that CC2 is not critical for tetramerization, localization or proper function of the channel. This is in general agreement with earlier observations showing that naturally occurring PC2 mutants lacking the C-terminus (L703X, R742X) still form oligomers and co-immunoprecipitate full-length PC2, implying the presence of a proximal dimerization domain in the N-terminus of PC2 (Feng et al, 2008). At variance, a recent study suggested that CC2 forms a homotrimer (Yu et al, 2009). The threefold symmetry shown in Yu et al (2009) is difficult to reconciliate with the fourfold symmetry of functional TRP channels (Tsuruda et al, 2006; Phelps and Gaudet, 2007) and with the recently described homo- and hetero-oligomeric PC2 channels (e.g. PC2/TRPV4 and PC2/TRPC1) (Bai et al, 2008a; K\u00f6ttgen et al, 2008; Kobori et al, 2009; Zhang et al, 2009). It is therefore likely that the CC2 motif-containing helix oligomerizes differently as an isolated peptide than when embedded in the folded protein. It is well known that the oligomerization state and orientation of coiled-coil helices are highly sensitive to minor alterations in the sequence or the chemical environment. For example, the GCN4 leucine zipper, one of the most widely used model systems in coiled-coil research, has been converted from a parallel dimer to at least seven different topologies by (often just one) point mutation. Truncation is also known to affect the oligomerization state of coiled-coil domains. For example, in the S2 fusion subunit of SARS coronavirus, the full-length central coiled coil is a parallel trimer, whereas a truncated fragment is an anti-parallel tetramer (Deng et al, 2006). A construct from the SKCa channel, which encompasses much of the coiled coil, has been solved as a parallel trimer (Kim et al, 2008), even though the native receptor is known to be tetrameric. This effect has also been observed in ion channels homologous to PC2. It has recently been shown that the coiled coil of the KCNQ1 (Kv7.1) channel, which has been determined as a parallel tetramer (Wiener et al, 2008), switches to a parallel trimer on truncation of 10 residues from the C-terminal tetramer (Xu and Minor, 2009). These results emphasize the fact that small changes in the amino sequence can have drastic effects on the oligomerization state, switching a four-stranded coiled coil into a three-stranded coiled coil. It is noteworthy in this respect that the crystal structure of PC2 G833\u2013G895 by Yu et al (2009) lacks 23 residues (896\u2013919) from the putative parallel tetramer.",

The domain responsible for heterodimerization with PC1 is just distal to CC2 and extends from aa872 to aa895, in agreement with earlier studies (Tsiokas et al, 1997; Yu et al, 2009). Interestingly, CC2 is conserved down to lower vertebrates and invertebrates, suggesting that it represents an evolutionarily critical functional domain. Although absent from most TRP channels, it is also conserved in PKD2L1, which binds to PKD1L3 to form a sour taste receptor (Ishimaru et al, 2006; LopezJimenez et al, 2006). This suggests that CC2 is likely to direct channel assembly in other cases and may represent a general strategy for the assembly of prototypical PC1/PC2-like complexes.",

The region N-terminal to the first TM is clearly required for proper PM subdomain localization of PC2 (Geng et al, 2006; Streets et al, 2006) and contains a dimerization site, which possibly in conjunction with transmembrane domains, regulates channel tetramerization (Feng et al, 2008). The C-terminus of PC2, although not essential for channel tetramerization, provides an essential scaffolding platform for heteromeric assembly with other proteins and molecules required for the regulation of channel activity (Ca2+, PC1, TRPC1, InsP3R) (Tsiokas et al, 1999; Koulen et al, 2002; Li et al, 2005; Celic et al, 2008). Our data therefore show that the function of CC2 goes well beyond just assisting channel assembly and constitutes a dedicated domain for the formation of supramolecular entities and the specification of different heteromeric PC2 complexes.",

CC2 was the signal responsible for ER cisternal stack formation because ER stacks were not present in untransfected cells and in cells transfected with constructs encoding CC2 mutants. Regular arrays of ER membranes, reminiscent of the cisternal stacks observed by us, have been previously noted in cells overexpressing ER-resident proteins including HMG-CoA reductase and InsP3Rs (Anderson et al, 1983; Takei et al, 1994). Here again, a crucial requirement for the formation of cisternal stacks was the property of the cytosolic domains of the overexpressed proteins to bind through homo/heterotypic interactions with proteins on adjacent ER membranes. As this phenomenon is not normally seen in epithelial kidney cells, the significance of exogenous PC2-induced cisternal stacks remains unclear. It may reflect, however, a potential mechanism of communication by polycystin proteins.",

Consistent with reported data that PC1 is required to bring PC2 to the PM and co-assemble a polycystin complex, disruption of CC2 abolished ion channel activity of a PM PC1/PC2 complex. Besides functioning as an integral PM receptor/cation channel, our data also reveal for the first time that PC1/PC2 complex can function as a receptor/Ca2+-release channel that regulates the activity of PC2 located in the ER but tethered close to the cell surface through its C-terminal interaction with PC1 (Koulen et al, 2002). These functional data accord well with earlier biochemical data showing that Endo H-resistant PC1 can interact with a pool of Endo H-sensitive PC2 in lateral cell membranes of renal epithelial cells (Newby et al, 2002). The complex between the two polycystins should be co-assembled in subdomains where plasma and ER membranes may be in close apposition, possibly through a mechanism akin to that described above for the formation of stacked ER membranes. A simplified view of the proposed organization of polycystin complexes is depicted in the Supplementary Figure 10. Physical linkage between proteins in the surface membrane and the ER are crucial for spatio-temporal coding of Ca2+ events (Delmas and Brown, 2002) and have been implicated in mediating CRAC channel activation (Luik et al, 2008), cross-talk between InsP3Rs and TRP channels (Birnbaumer et al, 2000; Delmas et al, 2002b) and excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle.",

Expression of hCC2 mutant capRNAs was sufficient to induce pronephric cyst formation, body axis curvature and hydrocephalus. Further analysis indicated that expression of hCC2 mutants was as efficient as pkd2ATG morphants in causing pronephric cysts. This could be explained if human CC2 mutants form oligomeric channels with zebrafish PC2, sequestering this subunit away from interacting with zebrafish PC1.",

In contrast to the similar effects of CC2 mutant capRNA expression on pronephric cyst formation, they had lesser effects on cardiac left\u2013right asymmetry compared with pkd2 morphants. These data are consistent with the preserved but reduced ER Ca2+-release channel activity of the CC2 mutants. As PC2 is normally ER localized in the absence of PC1, we hypothesize that ER-anchored PC2 (at the embryonic node) has a critical function in the development of left\u2013right asymmetry.",

CT2 truncations containing or deleting two predicted coiled-coil regions, CC1 (769\u2013796) and CC2 (833\u2013873) were used as baits to refine the minimal interacting sequence. Site-specific mutations in CC2 (CT2-4M: V846A, I853A, I860A, L867A) but not two other changes (R807Q, S812A), disrupted this interaction. Coiled-coil domains are indicated. (B) Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) analysis of His-CT2 and His-CT2-4M by sedimentation velocity plotted as the distribution of sedimentation coefficients (s). Absorbance (275 nm) data for 0.6 mg/ml samples are shown. The major peak for His-CT2 sediments around 4 s, whereas that for His-CT2-4M sediments around 2 s. The MW of the major His-CT2 peak was measured as 69.9 kDa by sedimentation equilibrium. (C) Cross-linking assays of His-CT2 and His-CT2-4M with DSS. Faint dimers of His-CT2 can be detected in situ and the protein cross-linked by DSS into prominent dimers and tetramers. In contrast, His-CT2-4M protein exists only as monomers and there is no detectable cross-linking by DSS. (D) Expression of epitope-tagged PC2 and mutant PC2 on non-reducing SDS\u2013PAGE. Wild-type PC2 migrates most prominently as dimeric species. Mutation of CC2 (PC2-4M) results in a predominant monomeric pattern with a faint dimeric species. PC2 mutants that include (R872X) or exclude (R742X) the CC2 region show a migration pattern similar to wild type or PC2-4M, respectively. (E) Co-immunoprecipitation of co-expressed HA-PC2 with Pk-PC2 or Pk-PC2-4M in HEK293 cells. Unlike CT2, mutation of CC2 in full-length PC2 (PC2-4M) does not abrogate full-length PC2 association.
