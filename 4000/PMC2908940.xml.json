            "text": "The development of technology to readily produce mAb enabled the systematic cataloging of leukocyte cell surface molecules and prompted the first Leukocyte Typing Workshop in 1984 [1]. This and subsequent workshops assigned leukocyte\u2010binding mAb to groups termed \u201cclusters of differentiation\u201d, or CD antigens, by virtue of common patterns of binding to panels of primary hematopoietic cells and cell lines. In this way, the CD13 cell surface molecule was defined as a marker of cells of the myeloid lineage in normal and leukemic cells. Subsequent molecular cloning of the CD13 cDNA showed that it was identical to the membrane\u2010tethered peptidase APN [2] and was expressed on cells, in addition to those of the hematopoietic system, such as the epithelial cells of the renal proximal tubules and the intestinal brush border, cells of the brain, fibroblasts, and activated endothelial cells [3].",

            "text": "CD13 is a large 150\u2010kD type II protein with a short cytoplasmic domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane region, and a large extracellular domain containing its enzymatic activity. As an extracellular peptidase, CD13 functions to cleave single neutral amino acids from the N terminus of small peptides, and therefore, its substrates and functions vary depending on the tissue where it is expressed. For example, in the brain, CD13 cleaves opioid peptides and enkephalins to regulate neuronal signaling, and in the intestine, it cleaves peptides to facilitate amino acid resorption [3]. The persistent and specific myeloid expression of CD13 on normal cells of the hematopoietic lineage has prompted numerous studies that have implicated CD13 in a variety of myeloid cell functions, primarily in assays that correlate CD13 expression with a particular function, inhibit enzymatic activity with chemical inhibitors or inhibitory antibodies, or activate CD13 using ligand\u2010mimicking cross\u2010linking antibodies. To address the function of CD13 directly and genetically, we created a global KO of CD13 and tested these animals for phenotypic effects on a number of myeloid functions attributed previously to CD13, such as myeloid differentiation, phagocytosis, antigen presentation, and inflammatory processes. We find that CD13 expression is dispensable for hematopoietic development and physiologic homeostasis and suggest that its function in myeloid cells may be dependent specifically on particular immune challenges to generate cross\u2010linking ligands.",

We constructed a floxed CD13\u2010targeting construct with the frt\u2010neo\u2010frt region using recombineering methods [5] with the assistance of the GTTF (UCHC, Farmington, CT, USA). The schematic of the targeting strategy is depicted below (see Fig. 1). The targeting vector was electroporated into the murine ES cell line D from the (129SvEvTac)/Cb7BL/6J mouse strain, and neomycin\u2010resistant colonies containing the targeting constructs were expanded and transferred into pseudopregnant females, resulting in chimeric mice containing the targeted CD13 allele. Germ\u2010line transmission of the targeted allele was confirmed, and the neo cassette was excised to produce mice carrying a floxed CD13 allele. Finally, floxed CD13 animals were mated with transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under the ubiquitous Hprt gene promoter (129S1\u2010Hprt1\ntm1(cre)Mnn/J, Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) to produce the global CD13 null strain. The CD13 global KO animals have been backcrossed subsequently to the C57Bl/6 strain, and experiments described in this report were performed with CD13ko/ko and control mice (CD13wt/wt) backcrossed for at least six generations to the C57BL/6J strain (Jackson Laboratory). The mice were housed in the animal facilities at the UCHC in accordance with Institutional and Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare guidelines. CD13 deletion was assessed using PCR genotyping, mRNA expression analysis (RT\u2010PCR), immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometric analysis (described below).",

The mCD13 gene is encoded by 20 exons spanning nearly 40 kB on chromosome 7. A BAC containing the CD13 gene identified by BLAST analysis was obtained from the CHORI BAC repository and confirmed by Southern blot analysis (data not shown). Repeated attempts to target the 5\u2032\u2010most region of the CD13 gene resulted in no recombinants and prompted the revised strategy depicted in \nFigure 1A\n, where LoxP recombination sites were inserted in introns between exons 3 and 4 and 13 and 14. Exposure of this construct to the cre recombinase would result in a gene lacking exons 4\u201313, which encode the enzymatic active site, the putative NGR\u2010binding site [10], and the majority of the extracellular portion of the molecule. In addition, splicing between exons 3 and 14 introduces a frame\u2010shift resulting in a stop codon early in exon 14, which would be predicted to produce a protein lacking exons 4\u201320 (as depicted in Fig. 1B). We have observed that relatively slight modifications to the CD13 protein severely impair its trafficking to the cell surface and would predict that the large alteration induced by this deletion would similarly affect cell surface expression. Indeed, transfection of the C33a human epithelial cell line with a mutant V5\u2010tagged CD13 expression construct lacking exons 4\u201320 showed no cell surface expression of the V5 tag (Fig. 1C). Transfection of murine ES cells with the targeting construct resulted in five founder lines in the C57Bl/6 \u00d7 129 mixed background, and one 6H11 was expanded for further study. After germ\u2010line transmission was confirmed, the mice were crossed to a transgenic strain expressing the Cre recombinase under the control of the ubiquitous HPRT promoter on a mixed background to create global CD13 null animals. Homozygous KOs were healthy and fertile with no overt phenotypic or serologic abnormalities (data not shown), consistent with an independently derived CD13 null strain [13]. Deletion of the floxed region of the CD13 locus in homozygous null animals was confirmed by PCR analysis (Fig. 1D), and evaluation of CD13 mRNA and protein expression by RT\u2010PCR (Fig. 1E) and immunohistochemistry indicated a complete lack of expression in kidney and small intestine (Fig. 1F), spleen, colon, and liver (not shown) tissue of the null animals as compared with abundant expression in the renal proximal tubules and brush border microvilli of WT controls. Interestingly, functional assessment of the deletion with a standard colorimetric CD13 substrate Ala\u2010pNa (Fig. 1G, left; ref [14]) showed a striking retention of peptidase activity in the serum of null animals, although only background levels of the CD13 protein were present in these samples when assessed by ELISA (Fig. 1G, right), suggesting that this commonly used method of assessing CD13 levels measures other peptidase activities as well, and results using this assay should be interpreted with caution.",

In normal and neoplastic hematopoietic populations, CD13 is expressed specifically on the earliest cell committed to the myeloid lineage (CFU\u2010GM) and all of its differentiated progeny and is a reliable diagnostic marker for certain types of leukemia [3]. More recently, CD13 has been shown to be highly expressed on adult pluripotent stem cells derived from multiple sites [15, 16, 17] and differentiated ES cells [18, 19], as well as subsets of peripheral blood progenitor cells [20]. In addition, CD13 has been postulated to play a role in fetal liver hematopoiesis [21] and myeloid cell differentiation [22]. Finally, CD13 expression has been reported to be controlled by various hematopoietic differentiation factors such as IL\u20104 and TGF\u2010\u03b2 [23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. However, its specific contribution to normal hematopoiesis is unknown. Flow cytometric analysis of BM, spleen, and thymic cell populations showed an indistinguishable distribution of cells of the myeloid B and T cell populations in WT and CD13 null adult animals (\nFig. 2\n), with the exceptions of a significant (P=0.025) increase in numbers of the thymic CD4 populations in CD13 null mice, which is not seen in peripheral organs, and a modest but nonsignificant trend toward an increase in CD11b+ cells (but not CD11b+/F4/80+ cells) in the BM of CD13\u2212/\u2212 mice. Furthermore, in vitro quantification of functional hematopoietic progenitor populations (hematopoietic stem cell, early lymphoid progenitors, and immature B cells) in spleen and BM indicated no difference in total colony\u2010forming ability of precursors from the WT versus null animals (data not shown), suggesting that CD13 is not a critical regulator of developmental hematopoiesis or hemostasis.",

Further analysis of the CD11b high population with the F4.80 macrophage marker in WT and null animals shows identical cytometric profiles (Fig. 3D), arguing against a developmental defect resulting from the lack of CD13 in myeloid cells, and validating the use of this population in our in vitro assays.

The latter study found enhanced phagocytosis of antibody\u2010modified target cells and prolonged downstream signaling upon engagement of the Fc\u03b3R in the presence of cross\u2010linking mAb to CD13 in primary monocytes or myeloid cell lines, suggesting that CD13 may be a functional regulator of this receptor. To address the contribution of CD13 to this process, we isolated BM macrophages (Fig. 4B, left) or resident (Fig. 4B, right) or elicited (not shown) primary peritoneal macrophages from WT and CD13 null mice and assayed their ability to phagocytose IgG\u2010opsonized or control, nonopsonized sheep RBCs.

No difference was observed in the microfilament\u2010dependent phagocytic uptake of the opsonized target cells in any of the myeloid lineages tested; thus, CD13 is apparently dispensable for Fc\u03b3R\u2010mediated phagocytosis in macrophages and DCs. However, a reproducible reduction in actin\u2010independent basal uptake by the null cells was apparent, which was possibly relevant to studies implicating CD13 in lipid uptake and metabolism [33, 34, 35] and those proposing that CD13 is a target of the cholesterol uptake inhibitor Ezetimibe in enterocytes and macrophages [36, 37]. To address a potential role of CD13 in actin\u2010independent endocytic processes, we assessed scavenger receptor\u2010mediated uptake of oxLDL, which has been reported to be unaffected by cytochalasin D treatment [38]. Although untreated cells of either genotype showed no lipid uptake (not shown), the percentage of lipid\u2010containing CD13 null BMDMs (Fig. 4C, left) or peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 4C, right) was comparable with that seen with WT cells, again, suggesting that CD13 is not required for Fc\u03b3R\u2010mediated phagocytosis or scavenger receptor\u2010mediated endocytosis.",

In the current study, we describe the production and analysis of a mouse strain harboring a floxed CD13 allele crossed with the ubiquitously expressed HPRT\u2010cre transgenic to delete nearly 40% of the coding region of the gene, including regions specifying the enzymatic active site and the zinc\u2010coordinating region.

However, we find that CD13 is undetectable at the mRNA level using primers spanning the nondeleted region (nt 43\u2013893). This agrees with our in vitro data showing that expression of a construct containing a truncated cDNA with exons 1\u20133 does not produce a detectable, tagged protein (Fig. 1C), probably as a result of instability of the truncated mRNA or incorrect folding of the truncated molecule. Similarly, immunohistochemical, flow cytometric, and ELISA assays confirm that the CD13 protein is not detectable in cells and tissue from these animals.

However, our microarray analysis of peritoneal and BMDMs showed a striking similarity in expression levels among genes in the WT and null cells, arguing against compensation. With regard to enzymatic activity and substrate cleavage, the argument for redundancy is more compelling, as numerous cell surface peptidases share overlapping substrate specificities. In this regard, although the preferred substrates of CD13 are N\u2010terminal neutral amino acids, it can also cleave charged residues, albeit less efficiently. It is possible that another enzyme is substituting for CD13 to produce the necessary cleavage products. Another possibility is that many of the published studies implicating CD13 used monocytic cell lines and human peripheral blood monocytes, and in the current study, we used primary macrophages and DCs. It is formally possible that CD13 plays distinct roles in monocytes and more differentiated myeloid cells, which is not addressed in the current study. Finally, it has been shown that genes contributed by the C57Bl/6 background strain can compensate for a lack of critical adhesion molecules in inflammatory responses, particularly peritonitis [51]. This may be relevant to our studies, as the experiments described were performed on animals, where 96% of their background genes were contributed by the C57Bl/6 strain. In the previous study, the effects of inflammatory challenge in PECAM\u20101 (CD31) WT and null mice on the C57Bl/6 background were indistinguishable, and animals lacking PECAM\u20101 on the FVB background showed severe impairment of their inflammatory responses.

Although this study is not exhaustive, we have focused on processes where CD13 has been implicated previously in studies using inhibitors or antibodies or where CD13 expression was shown to correlate with a particular function, as these would be particularly relevant to this loss\u2010of\u2010function analysis. For example, although treatment of animals with the CD13 inhibitor aprotinin showed a significant decrease in disease severity in the DSS model of inflammatory bowel disease [52], weight loss, the percent of ulceration, and spleen weight in CD13 null animals are indistinguishable from that of WT animals. Similarly, numerous studies have implicated a role for CD13 in aspects of human T cell biology, where it has been reported to be expressed on peripheral T cell subsets and activated T cells [53], where generally, treatment with CD13 inhibitors was described to diminish T cell proliferation via increases in TGF\u2010\u03b2 production [28, 29, 30, 54]. This result seems at odds with our observation of a significant increase in the numbers of CD4+ T cells in the null thymus but may be a result of the disparate origins (peripheral vs. thymic) of the T cells studied. Alternatively, it is possible that lack of CD13 alters the tight regulation of thymocyte selection, proliferation, or survival. Identification of the specific T cell subset(s) affected, determination if the increase were T cell\u2010intrinsic or a result of stromal effects, and a possible impact on thymocyte trafficking will be necessary to determine the exact mechanisms responsible for the increase in thymic CD4+ cells in CD13 null animals. Finally, although we have not focused specifically on T cell functions, the MLR measures the ability of primarily CD4+ T cells to recognize and proliferate in response to a foreign histocompatibility antigen (MHC I or MHC II) presented by allogeneic APCs in the culture. As such, it is a means of assessing the capacity of the cells for self\u2010recognition as well as the levels and context of MHC and costimulatory molecules, which are important for regulating the cell interactions involved in normal immune responses. We found no significant differences in the function of CD13 null cells when used as responder or stimulator cells, suggesting that CD13 is not critical for T cell proliferation and that the levels and context of molecules required for alloantigen presentation (stimulator) cells are unaffected in the null cells.

Actin\u2010independent mechanisms have been illustrated for receptor\u2010mediated and receptor\u2010independent endocytosis and appear to be dependent on the particular antigen and the cell type [55, 56]. We [57] and others [36, 58, 59, 60] have implicated CD13 previously in internalization of distinct surface proteins in various cell types. For example, in endothelial cells, we demonstrated that inhibition of CD13 impairs internalization of the bradykinin/bradykinin receptor complex by perturbing lipid raft organization, effectively inhibiting downstream signal transduction, filopodia formation, and cell invasion [57].

However, we see no difference in Fc\u03b3R\u2010mediated uptake of similarly opsonized targets in the presence or absence of CD13. This may indicate that similar to other ligand\u2010binding signaling receptors, CD13 must be cross\u2010linked first to induce downstream signal transduction cascades. Alternatively, the comparable phagocytic capacity of cells with or without CD13 could point to the fact that although CD13 cross\u2010linking may trigger processes that complement those elicited by the Fc\u03b3R, it does not normally do so. Finally, it is possible that CD13 may be important in the phagocytosis of certain types of opsonized antigens that are also CD13 cross\u2010linking ligands, which would engage the FcR and CD13 and thus, be internalized more efficiently.

It is clear that in many pathologic settings (such as wound\u2010healing, tumors, ischemic injury), the cytokines produced by infiltrating, inflammatory cells promote robust angiogenesis [61, 62, 63].
