PCR primers are designed for each target so that the amplicon length serves as a unique identifier for each particular target. Each amplicon must vary by at least 5 nucleotides in size. Aliquots of the multiplex PCR reaction are removed after successive PCR cycles and separated by CE. Amplification curves are reconstructed based on the area under each amplified target. As for conventional real-time PCR, cycle thresholds (CT) can be determined from the graphs thereby allowing the determination of initial copy number for each amplified template. For applications that quantify RNA levels, STAR can be modified to a one-step reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR reaction (see below).",

We do, however, find that the cycle threshold is often lower in multiplexed samples than samples amplified individually. This is likely due to more efficient or promiscuous priming during reverse transcription resulting from the increased number of primers present in multiplex reactions that can anneal to RNA templates at low reaction temperatures (42\u00b0C; Figure 2).",

In the case of RNA analysis, each sample is separately reverse transcribed using composite primers consisting of a sequence tag (ST1 or ST2) fused to gene-specific sequences. The sequence tags act as identifiers for the sample source. Resultant cDNAs are pooled and PCR amplified using a simplified primer set: reverse primers ST1 and ST2, each labeled with a different fluorophore thereby allowing the sample source to be identified by specific color, and a gene-specific primer for each target effectively reducing the number of required PCR primers in half (n sequences require n + 2 PCR primers). This approach dramatically decreases the complexity of PCR amplification thus allowing multiplexing even greater numbers of genes/biomarkers. This approach was used to perform comparative real-time quantification of three transcripts in drug-treated versus saline-treated tissue samples normalized by comparing expression levels of 18SrRNA. Results obtained using STAR technology confirmed the expression levels determined using microarray- and SYBR Green-based real-time RT-PCR (data not shown due to space limitation).",

Samples are separately reverse transcribed using primers that contain a sample-specific sequence tag (ST1 or ST2) fused to poly(T)n-VN that anchors the primer to the 5\u2032-end of the poly(A) tail. Samples are then mixed followed by second strand synthesis reaction using forward primers that combine a second sequence tag (UT2) fused to a short arbitrary nucleotide sequence (hexamer or octamer) that can prime at many loci. Based on random occurrence, hexamers should occur every 4096 bases and octamers every 65,536 bases. However, the frequency of hexamers in human expressed genome is not random and shows considerable bias (V. Cheung, personal communication). By selecting arbitrary sequences with care, a series of second strand primers can be developed that result in amplification of hundreds to thousands of cDNAs per reaction based on the current expressed sequence tag database. We estimate that 95% of the expressed genome can be covered with 20 second strand primers coupled to hexamers. Samples are then PCR amplified using reverse primers FAM-labeled ST1 and ROX-labeled ST2, and forward primer UT2.",

This method combines the quantitative capacity of real-time PCR with the vast separating power of CE allowing simultaneous measurement of dozens of DNA or RNA targets in a single reaction. Integration of PCR and CE for multiplexed assays was originally suggested as end-point PCR amplification followed by analysis and quantification of the amplified targets by CE in which each target DNA was identified based on amplicon length.26 This approach was successfully applied to gene expression analysis22,27 and diagnostic applications28,29,30,31 using end-point PCR detection. However, real-time PCR is preferred to endpoint PCR due to better precision and broader dynamic range of quantitative measurements.32 Li and colleagues33 furthered the technology demonstrating that parallel single gene PCR reactions terminated after successive cycles and analyzed by CE results in amplification curves for real-time analysis of a single target. STAR technology extends this concept to enable real-time PCR algorithms for quantification of multiple targets within a single reaction. Rather than setting up separate PCR reactions for each aliquot, STAR monitors PCR amplification by withdrawing an aliquot from the same reaction tube after each successive cycle. This arrangement decreases the total volume required for PCR, avoids variability caused by nonuniform thermocycling across PCR plates, and permits simpler design of an analytical instrument (for example by using direct electrokinetic transfer from PCR tube to the capillary).",

We find that PCR efficiencies observed for each of the methods are within the range of experimental error (Table 2) and are likely to reflect the different fluorescent labeling methods used. We have previously found that amplification efficiencies can be differentially affected by covalent modifications of primers (data not shown). TaqMan assays can also show variable PCR efficiencies based on nucleotide composition, hybridization kinetics, and probe positioning.34 This result is in good agreement with other multiplex real-time PCR methods in which efficiency of multiplex PCR could be optimized to the level of single gene amplification.35 We also observed consistently lower threshold cycles for STAR assays than for TaqMan and SYBR assays. This observation can be partly explained by differences in the detection methods used (laser-induced fluorescence reading using ABI 3100 Prism instrument, versus charge-coupled device camera readings on the Bio-Rad ICycler real-time PCR system). However, there is a fundamental difference in the sensitivity of STAR and other optical real-time PCR methods due to reaction mechanisms. STAR directly measures fluorescence of the PCR product, whereas TaqMan and SYBR assess a secondary reaction that relies on an interaction between the PCR product and a signal-generating probe or dye, respectively. It is therefore not unexpected that methods based on the detection of primary PCR products are more sensitive than methods based on secondary signal-generating probe or dye intercalation.",

For targets that show high sequence variability such as HIV-1,36 a broader scope of options for primer design is available. Second, because detection does not require probe hydrolysis, all restrictions related to the probe design (probe length and composition, distance to PCR primers) do not influence primer selection. Third, STAR technology has the potential to analyze hundreds of targets per reaction due to discrimination of DNA fragments both by size and fluorophore color. Current real-time PCR methods are limited to four targets per reaction. Finally, as specific PCR products are well separated from potential nonspecific PCR products (for example, primer-dimers), primer design criteria for STAR protocols can be relaxed.",

We have also developed an in-house single nucleotide polymorphism assay that multiplexes 20 alleles within a single reaction (data not shown). To our knowledge, these are the first examples of real-time PCR of more than 10 genes simultaneously. Importantly, development of this assay required no primer optimization because the first set selected by commonly used primer design software was successfully implemented. Moreover, multiplexing with STAR is only limited by the separation power of CE, which can separate hundreds of DNA fragments differing by a single nucleotide in size. However, expanding STAR multiplex assays to include dozens to hundreds of targets using gene-specific primers can result in severe background due to primer interactions and nonspecific amplification. The alternate priming strategies outlined that result in incorporation of sequence tags dramatically simplifies the PCR reaction by reducing the number of primers required, thereby decreasing background amplification.",

Zhong and Yeung37 have similarly found that tissue-specific patterns of cDNAs are generated when RNA is reverse transcribed using random hexamers. We anticipate that a genetic fingerprint can be defined for various tissues for each second strand primer used. Each fragment can be predicted from available genomic sequence data or identified by sequencing to define the expressed transcriptome for each of the tissues. Because the real-time quantitative algorithm used in STAR provides better quantification of small differences as well as a much broader dynamic range allowing broadly expressed transcripts to be analyzed, this database could serve as a diagnostic tool because the presence/absence and expression level of each fragment would be known. Novel amplicons may represent overexpressed genes, products of gene fusion, or trans-splicing, alternatively spliced genes, or genes derived from pathogens.

            "text": "Besides applications for gene expression analyses, multiplexed assays using STAR protocols offer considerable advantages for molecular diagnostics. In addition to the obvious consideration of cost, multiplexed assays require less sample material to be withdrawn from patients, and much simpler logistics regarding laboratory tests. As a first step in the development of multiplexed diagnostic assays based on STAR technology we designed an assay for quantitative measurement of SARS-CoV. This assay was developed as a one-step RT-PCR to detect and quantify SARS-CoV RNA throughout a broad concentration, ranging from several viral copies up to several hundred thousand viral copies per reaction. In a blinded study, our assay correctly identified both SARS-CoV target sequences from tissue samples obtained from a SARS-infected individual with titers ranging from 39,900 to 162 viral copies per reaction without showing any false-positives. The STAR assay for SARS-CoV detection used simultaneous amplification of several target sequences from the SARS-CoV genome to confirm specificity of the assay especially in the context of complex clinical samples. This assay serves as a prototype for diagnostic tests in which a single clinical sample can be assessed for the presence of several pathogens. Alternatively, targeting several regions of the pathogen genome may be necessary for detection of rapidly mutating organisms because use of a single pair of specific primers may lead to false-negatives due to mutation of that site. This could be particularly important in the case when mutations are associated with virulence or drug resistance.38",

            "text": "STAR technology could be used for many immediate applications, most of which require multiplexing in the range of several dozen genes rather than hundreds. Such applications may include quantitative analysis of gene sets comprising a molecular signature for a biological process, effects of drug treatment on gene expression, and transcriptional signatures of disease conditions (identified in transcriptional profiling studies using DNA microarrays). An added benefit of the STAR approach is its scalability and flexibility regarding multigene assays. Any STAR assay can be easily updated by addition or subtraction of particular primer pair(s) as long as there is no overlap in amplicon size. Finally, the STAR protocol is adaptable to high-throughput automation that in its simplest form would include a dispensing thermocycler coupled to CE.",

All of these applications should have the capacity to identify and to measure multiple pathogens in a single sample with high sensitivity in a cost-effective manner. The potential of STAR could be realized through the direct integration of PCR with ultra-fast CE separation. As a first step in STAR automation, we assembled a breadboard of the dispensing thermocycler to facilitate accurate sampling of PCR reaction. This system is based on the integration of a robotic fluid dispenser and a remotely operated thermocycler that will be described elsewhere. A specialized instrument that integrates PCR thermocycling, sample dispensing, and capillary-based separation is currently under development. Aside from instrument design, STAR development would also require a comprehensive bioinformatics package spanning multiplex primer design to management of gene expression data generated by STAR. As a first step, we developed a prototype software analysis program that facilitates the conversion of electropherogram data into real-time amplification plots thereby reducing the time required to analyze STAR-generated data from days to minutes. The features and benefits described above make the STAR approach a natural candidate for development of a broad array of multiplex assays.",
