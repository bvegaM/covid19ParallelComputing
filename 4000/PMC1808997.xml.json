            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a recently emerged infectious disease characterized by persistent fever, respiratory symptoms with lung consolidation, lymphopenia and respiratory failure in life-threatening cases [1\u20134]. Watery diarrhoea has also been manifested in some cases [5]. We found that lymphopenia and depletion of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes could be associated with disease activity and adverse outcomes in SARS [4]. The SARS-related deaths have resulted mainly from pulmonary complications, including progressive respiratory failure due to alveolar damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The causative agent of SARS has been identified as a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [6\u20138] with a genome sequence that is only moderately related to other known coronaviruses [9,10]. Rapid diagnostic tests using molecular techniques for the detection of SARS-CoV RNA have been developed recently [11,12]. Administration of the antiviral drug ribarivin together with systemic corticosteroid resulted in alleviation of inflammation, reduction of organ dysfunction and improvement on survival in the majority of SARS patients [1, 5, 13], although controlled clinical trials are required to confirm this regimen's genuine efficacy.",

For example, the H5N1 \u2018avian flu\u2019 influenza viruses are potent inducers of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 in macrophages [15]. In swine pneumonia, the production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 was found to correlate positively with disease severity [16]. Therefore, SARS sequalae such as transendothelial migration of PMN into lung tissue, multiple organ dysfunction and ARDS have been postulated to associate with cytokine and chemokine dysregulation [17,18]. In an attempt to study possible SARS-CoV-induced cytokine and chemokine dysregulation, to identify markers for disease severity, and to explore the feasibility of designing effective treatment strategy such as anti-cytokine therapy, we have prospectively investigated a panel of circulating T helper (Th) cell cytokines, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in patients with SARS.",

In CBA, five or six bead populations with distinct fluorescence intensities had been coated with capturing antibodies specific for different cytokines or chemokines. These bead populations could be resolved in the fluorescence channels of the flow cytometer. After the beads had been incubated with 50 \u00b5l of plasma, different cytokines or chemokines in the sample were captured by their corresponding beads. The cytokine/chemokine captured beads were then mixed with phycoerythrin-conjugated detection antibodies to form sandwich complexes. Following incubation, washing and acquisition of fluorescence data, the results were generated in graphical format using the BD CBA software. The concentrations of Th1/Th2 cytokines IL-2, IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3; inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12p70; and chemokines IL-8, regulated upon activation normal T cell-expressed and secreted (RANTES), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), IFN-\u03b3-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and monokine induced by IFN-\u03b3 (MIG) were measured using the human Th1/Th2 cytokine, inflammatory cytokine and chemokine CBA kits (BD Pharmingen, CA, USA), respectively.

After fever had persisted for more than 48 h and leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or both, had developed, oral ribavirin (40\u201360 mg/kg/day) and oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) were started as a combined regimen from 2 to 9 days after disease (fever) onset. Patients who did not respond clinically to standard empirical treatment including persistent fever, increasing shortness of breath, worsening lung opacities involving >50% of lung field in chest radiograph and deteriorating oxygen saturation to <90% by pulse oximetry, were given intravenous ribavirin (400 mg every 8 h) and an additional one to three pulses of 0\u00b75 g of methylprednisolone sodium succinate (methylprednisolone) daily.",

IL-1\u03b2 can act as the early response cytokine to viral infection such as that caused by the human immunodeficiency virus, for mediation of inflammatory response, synthesis of acute phase proteins and release of IL-8 [14,22]. IL-6 may play a proinflammatory role in pulmonary inflammation [23]. Th2 cytokine IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that suppresses the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines [24], therefore it was elevated in some patients 1 week after disease onset and followed the elevation of other inflammatory cytokines. IL-12, also known as natural killer (NK) cell stimulatory factor or cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor, is a pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokine which is produced primarily by antigen-presenting cells (monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and B cells) and PMN [25]. IL-12 can induce the production of IFN-\u03b3 and other Th1 cytokines with suppression of the Th2 pathway [26,27]. It has multiple effects on T lymphocytes and NK cells, including the ability to stimulate cytotoxicity, proliferation, cytokine production and the development of Th1 subsets [28,29]. Therefore, the observed early elevation of inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 could be causative of the SARS-CoV-induced activation of Th1 cells and NK cells, release of chemokines such as IL-8, and results in pulmonary inflammation [16].",

IL-8, the PMN \u03b1-chemokine, has been shown to be elevated in blood and alveolar spaces [34] and exhibit a positive correlation with the number of PMN in BAL fluid of patients with pneumonia and ARDS [35]. Our SARS-CoV-infected patients also showed elevation of plasma IL-8 soon after disease onset, which declined from 5 to 8 days after corticosteroid treatment. In our former clinical study, 82% of 157 SARS patients developed neutrophilia and the high neutrophil counts were associated with ICU admission and mortality from pneumonia [4]. Therefore, PMN-induced acute pneumonitis should be crucial in the pathogenesis of ARDS and pulmonary destruction in SARS patients.",

MCP-1 concentration has been shown to increase in BAL fluid of patients with persistent ARDS [36], correlating positively with the predominance of alveolar macrophages [37] that has also been found in the postmortem examination of SARS patients [2,38]. IP-10 is a specific chemoattractant for Th1 cells for the activation of cell-mediated immune response; its expression can be up-regulated by the Th1 cytokine IFN-\u03b3 in acute lung inflammation [39]. Consistently, our results showed that both circulating IFN-\u03b3 and IP-10 were increased in SARS patients. Our observation of low or normal Th2 cytokine IL-4 in SARS patients is also similar to the finding of a previous study of viral pneumonia [40]. These suggest that SARS-CoV does not enhance the Th2 pathway and the subsequent humoral immue response. Such imbalance of Th1/Th2 cytokine profile confirms the SARS-CoV-induced Th1 predominance. In contrast to H5N1 infection [15], plasma TNF-\u03b1 was not elevated in our patients. This finding, therefore, does not support the therapeutic use of TNF-\u03b1 monoclonal antibody for SARS. However, it must be cautioned that the concentration of TNF-\u03b1 at the pulmonary inflammatory sites has not been investigated. Previous studies have implicated that inflammatory IL-\u03b2 and the acute-phase cytokine IL-6 are endogenous pyrogens or inducers of fever [41]. Therefore, elevations of IL-\u03b2 and IL-6 might account for the fever onset, as both of them were found to have high plasma concentrations during the first week of disease. Moreover, the T cell chemokines MIG and RANTES also did not show any significantly elevation. Therefore, the recruitment of activated T cells in pulmonary tissue should be studied by performing chemokine assay and differential cell count in BAL fluids, although this should be difficult because of the high risk of infection.",

            "text": "In summary, we postulate that the elevation of the plasma chemokines IL-8, MCP-1 and IP-10, Th1-related cytokine IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12, and inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 can induce the hyperinnate inflammatory response due to the SARS-CoV invasion of the respiratory tract. This leads to the recruitment and accumulation of alveolar macrophages and PMN [42], as well as the activation of Th1 cell-mediated immunity by the stimulation of NK and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Treatment with immunosuppressive corticosteroid can significantly suppress the elevated chemokines IL-8, IP-10 and MCP-1, and subsequently alleviate the chemokine-associated pulmonary inflammation in SARS. Indeed, the reduction in IL-8, IP-10 and MCP-1 correlated with the improvement in general clinical condition, pulmonary function and radiological appearance in SARS patients of our present study. In addition, we also observed that higher disease severity was associated with more elevated plasma IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IP-10 and MCP-1 concentrations (Fig. 3). It can be postulated that the addition of pulsed steroid in the severe-disease group not only controlled the rapidly deteriorating clinical condition, but basically attenuated the otherwise over-exaggerated immunological response with potentially much high median concentrations of plasma cytokines and chemokines. This further supports that the above cytokines and chemokines played important roles in the immunopathological mechanisms of SARS. We have initiated a study comparing plasma cytokines and chemokines in SARS patients with and without corticosteroid treatment. The elevated plasma cytokines and chemokines should also shed light on the possibility of using them as prognostic indicators for disease severity in SARS. For example, the presence of high anti-IL-8 : IL-8 complexes in BAL fluid has been shown to be an important prognostic indicator for ARDS [43].",

            "text": "Although our study has provided some understanding of the immunological mechanisms of inflammation in SARS and the therapeutic effects of corticosteroid, many further investigations are required to explore the detailed pathophysiology of this novel emerging disease with global impact. In order to correlate cytokine release with disease severity, in vitro mechanistic study of cytokine induction using SARS-CoV and immune cell culture, and eventually the measurement of cytokine and chemokine concentrations at local inflammatory sites should be contemplated. Other chemokines such as epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide (ENA)-78, a neutrophil chemoattractant [30], and macrophage inflammatory peptide-1 alpha (MIP-1\u03b1), a monocyte chemoattractant [30], should be measured. Recently, transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 has been shown to be active early in acute lung injury, and potentially contribute to the development of pulmonary oedema [44]. Therefore, the role of TGF-\u03b2 in SARS also requires investigation. Given the prominent roles of cytokines and chemokines in the pathogenesis of SARS, anticytokine/chemokine immunotherapy using anticytokine/chemokine antibodies (e.g. anti-IL-8, anti-MCP-1) or cytokine/chemokine antagonists may represent a novel approach for the treatment of hyperactive inflammation in SARS [45,46].",
