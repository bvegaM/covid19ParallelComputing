The resulting plasmid was transformed into the Eschericia Coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS expression cells (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA). Bacterial growth was done at 37 \u00b0C in Luria broth medium in the presence of ampicillin (200 \u03bcg/mL) and chloramphenicol (30 \u03bcg/mL). Expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl \u03b2\u2010d\u2010thiogalactopyranoside. After 3 h of expression, cells were harvested and centrifuged at 4000 \u00d7 g for 10 min and frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C. Purification was done under denaturing conditions. Cell pellet was thawed in ice, resuspended in lysis buffer A which is composed of 9 m urea, 100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris and 10 mm\u03b2\u2010mercaptoethanol, pH 8 and lysed by sonication. The cell membranes were removed by centrifugation (45 min at 30 500 \u00d7 g). The supernatant was then incubated with nickel beads (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) for 1 h. Protein contaminants were washed from the column using a pH gradient. The first wash was done with lysis buffer A and the second and third washes at pH 6.3 and 5.9, respectively, with a buffer containing 9 m urea, 100 mm NaH2PO4, 20 mm sodium citrate, 10 mm imidazole and 10 mm\u03b2\u2010mercaptoethanol. Elution was done at pH 5.0 again with 9 m urea, 100 mm NaH2PO4, 20 mm sodium citrate, 10 mm imidazole and 10 mm\u03b2\u2010mercaptoethanol. Purity was verified by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Peptide identity was confirmed with mass spectrometry. Following purification, the denatured monomeric peptides were dialyzed against the refolding buffer 20 mm Tris pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl and 10% glycerol containing 8 m urea followed by 6 m urea, 4 m urea, 2 m urea, 1 m urea and no urea in the same refolding buffer.

In particular, the protein shells of many spherical viruses have icosahedral symmetry. In an attempt to mimic nature\u2019s design of small virus\u2019 capsids, Raman et al. (22) designed a single monomeric peptide building block that was predicted to form an icosahedral peptide nanoparticle. The idea behind the design of this building block is that the symmetry elements found in an icosahedron: fivefold, threefold and twofold rotational symmetry axes are also found in coiled\u2010coils. By using such peptidic coiled\u2010coil oligomerization domains with their respective symmetries, it was possible to design three\u2010dimensional building blocks that would form a peptide nanoparticle with icosahedral symmetry (Figure 2). Therefore, based on the design by Raman et al., our monomeric building blocks of the peptide nanoparticle consist of sequences than can form both, trimeric and pentameric coiled\u2010coils.",

Also, other self\u2010assembly states with an intermediate number of peptide chains may be possible; however, such nanoparticles will not have a regular icosahedral symmetry. In fact, the larger assemblies probably will not have exact T = 3 icosahedral symmetry, because this would require that the pentameric coiled\u2010coil would switch into a hexamer, which is unlikely for the COMP oligomerization domain.",

With the molecular weight obtained from sedimentation velocity experiments, it is possible to determine the number of monomers that constitute a peptide nanoparticle. Figure 5A displays a plot of the normalized sedimentation coefficient distribution, g(s*). The distributions peak near 29S. Using a calculated frictional ratio of 1.3, this sedimentation coefficient corresponds to nanoparticles with a molecular weight of about 1.4 MDa, that is \u223c110 peptide chains per nanoparticle. Based on this, the largest fraction of the peptide nanoparticle seems to be in between a T = 1 and 3 icosahedral symmetry, models of which are shown in Figure 2B. This would imply that the angle between the pentamer and trimer is on average slightly smaller than shown for a T = 1 symmetry in Figure 2A. If this is the case, then a smaller angle would allow more than 60 monomers to co\u2010assemble into a single nanoparticle. However, it is clear from the g(s*) distributions and the tail of the distribution curve to the higher S values that the sample is not homogeneous but rather contains a mixture of different species, which agrees with the data obtained from DLS and TEM. Similarly, Padilla et al. (34) found different sized species for a designed self\u2010assembling protein cage which they attributed to a certain degree of flexibility or polymorphism in the assembled particles.",

In MBP\u2010HRC\u2010GCN4, maltose\u2010binding protein was used as an expression tag and purification tag and the modified GCN4 sequence maintained the construct as a trimer while also stabilizing the HRC sequence (Figure 1C) as a trimeric coiled\u2010coil (36). In the dilution range 1:50 to 1:400, the antisera bound the plated MBP\u2010HRC\u2010GCN4 trimeric construct (Figure 6D). On the other hand, when the plates were coated with the synthetic HRC peptide (Figure 1C), which on its own forms an unfolded monomer when bound to ELISA plate, there was little or no binding (Figure 6E). The results with trimeric HRC (as in MBP\u2010HRC\u2010GCN4) (Figure 6D) and monomeric HRC (Figure 6E) indicate that the antibodies produced are conformation\u2010specific which is expected from the nanoparticle design and confirms that this is an optimal platform for the display of conformation\u2010specific epitopes with \u03b1\u2010helical and in particular with coiled\u2010coil conformations. Similarly, in previous experiments with template\u2010based coiled\u2010coil antigens (7) the HRC1 sequence was found to elicit antibodies that were conformation\u2010specific for the trimeric pre\u2010fusogenic state of HRC and were not able to bind to the post\u2010fusion six\u2010helix bundle state (21).

This most likely reflects the fact that a considerable fraction of the antibodies are directed against the core of the nanoparticle which is also surface accessible to a substantial degree. Another reason for this could be that the trimeric HRC1 coiled\u2010coils in the peptide nanoparticle contain free C\u2010terminal \u03b1\u2010carboxyl groups which do not exist in MBP\u2010HRC\u2010GCN4 or the native HRC peptide (C\u03b1\u2010amidated).
