MAb treatment was repeated 2 additional passages, passage 3 viruses were plaque purified in the presence of MAb, and neutralization-resistant viruses were isolated.

Of interest, several MAb escape mutants from different neutralization groups had amino acid changes in common (Table 1). The amino acid change associated with neutralization escape from S127.6 was a D480Y mutation, which was previously shown to decrease the neutralization efficacy of the 80R MAb [6]. The group I MAb S228.11, group IV MAb S110.4, and group VI MAb S215.17 were all selected for escape mutant viruses with an amino acid change at position 462. Finally, the generation of a MAb neutralization escape variant using MAb S227.14 was unsuccessful even after several attempts using both the icGZ02 [2] and the icUrbani isolate.

The structure of the SARS-CoV RBD complexed with ACE2 was recently resolved, allowing us to map the locations of the amino acid changes onto the RBD structure [7]. As previously shown, amino acid 332 of the RBD is critical for neutralization by MAb S109.8 and is located on the side of the RBD in a loop that is not in direct contact with the receptor ACE2 (Figure 2). Of interest, although MAbs S228.1, S224.17, S3.1, S110.4, S231.9, S215.17, and S230.15 recognize distinct antigenic groups based on their neutralizing profiles of isogenic viruses with variant S glycoproteins, the locations of the amino acid changes associated with the neutralization escape map were within 4 \u00e5ngstroms of each other (Figure 2). Unfortunately the location of the amino acid 777 alteration is downstream of the RBD and upstream of the heptad repeat region; therefore, no structural information was available. The D480Y change is likely part of or is influencing presentation of a distinct epitope recognized by MAb S127.6 and belonging to group III (Figure 2). Neutralization by the cross-neutralizing MAb S227.14 was not affected by any of the mutations generated by the other MAbs. The cross-neutralization data suggest that the amino acid change K390Q/E associated with MAb neutralization escape from S227.14 is uniquely separate from other escape mutants (Figure 2).",

All neutralization escape viruses grew efficiently in Vero E6 cells, reaching comparable peak titers of between 107 and 108 pfu/mL by 36 h after infection (Figure 3A). Replication of all viruses was delayed early in infection, as shown by a 1-to 2-log reduction in titer at 12 h after infection, compared with the wild-type icUrbani, with the exception of the escape mutant with a P462H change (P < .05, by 2-way analysis of variance). A similar trend was seen in DBT cells expressing the hACE2 molecule (Figure 3B). Growth in DBT cells expressing the cACE2 molecule was affected by all amino acid changes tested. All viruses, with the exception of the F460C mutant, reached peak titers of \u223c107 pfu/mL but were delayed 12 h after infection in replication, compared with icUrbani (Figure 3C).

To test this possibility, 12-month-old BALB/c mice were inoculated with either wild-type icUrbani, icGZ02, or icHC/SZ/61/03 and each of their respective neutralization escape mutants. Under these conditions, icUrbani resulted in a phenotype of \u223c15% weight loss. Of interest, although the Y777D change had an attenuating effect on in vitro growth, no difference could be detected between weight loss associated with the Y777D change and that associated with the icUrbani isolate (Figure 4A). In contrast, neutralization escape viruses with a D480Y or D463G change were attenuated, with infected mice losing only 5% of their weight by day 4 after infection, whereas viruses with a T332I, L443R, F460C, or P462H amino acid change were completely attenuated in aged animals (Figure 4A). Viral titers in the lungs of infected animals at day 5 after infection did not completely correlate with weight loss, as observed elsewhere [5]. The P462H mutant virus grew to titers comparable to those of icUrbani ( 106 pfu/g) (Figure 4B). However, T332I, F460C, and L443R mutant virus titers were significantly reduced by 1, 2, and 4 logs, respectively, compared with icUrbani titers. In agreement with these data, the T332I and L443R mutations previously generated in icGZ02 [2] were also completely attenuated in aged mice (data not shown). The K390E/Q mutants using the icHC/SZ/61/03 strain associated with neutralization escape from MAb S227.14 were completely attenuated in aged mice with no loss of weight, whereas the wild-type icHC/SZ/61/03- infected mice lost up to 20% of their weight by day 4 after infection, and 2 of 5 mice died (Figure 4C).

The structures of 2 MAbs complexed with the SARS-CoV RBD have been described elsewhere [15, 16]. The MAb m396 mainly recognizes a 10-residue (482\u2013491) loop that protrudes from the RBD surface and competes with S230.15 for binding to the RBD [22]. Because the S230.15 epitope includes the amino acid 443 residue that is distant from the m396 epitope, competition likely occurs through steric hindrance between the 2 MAbs. The 80R MAb was found to interact with 29 residues between 426 and 492 on the SARS-CoV RBD. The D480 residue was of particular interest, because mutations at this residue completely abolished binding to 80R. Of interest, a mutation at residue 480 was also found to affect the neutralization efficacy of one of the group III MAbs described in the present study (S127.6), suggesting that these MAbs recognize an identical or overlapping epitope, as hypothesized elsewhere [18].",

Recently, another study [17] demonstrated an association between amino acid changes in the S1 and S2 domains of SARS-CoV, affecting neutralization. Currently, the structure of the complete SARS-CoV S glycoprotein bound to its receptor ACE2 has not been elucidated, and, therefore, mapping the effects of long-range amino acid changes outside the RBD on the global S glycoprotein structure is not possible. However, these data suggest that the S1 and S2 domains of the S glycoprotein communicate with the RBD and may even interact physically in the higher-order structure of the S glycoprotein, as has been shown for other coronaviruses [23, 24]. Of importance, other domains outside the RBD have been targeted by neutralizing MAbs, including amino acids 130\u2013140 and HR-2 [25]. Although it is not clear whether these domains are associated with the RBD, our previous work also implicated changes at positions 77 and 244 as affecting neutralization of MAbs S132 and S228.11 after RBD binding [2].",

Because many of the escape mutants grew to similar titers after an initial delay in growth, the observed mutations likely mediate a reduced affinity of RBD for the hACE2 receptor, resulting in a delay in entry.

Although a mutation at residue 777 did not affect in vivo pathogenesis, all other mutations either partially or completely attenuated SARS-CoV infection in aged mice. A decrease in virulence of neutralization escape mutants has also been observed with H5 and H9 influenza viruses and has coincided with reduced affinity of the mutant HA for its receptor [26, 27]. Given the delayed growth of many of these escape mutants on cells expressing hACE2, we anticipate that they would be attenuated in humans. In addition, we were unsuccessful in isolating mutants resistant to the sequential generation of escape variants using different MAbs. Several attempts to rescue virus from escape mutants that were incubated with other neutralizing MAbs in the presence of the original MAb were unsuccessful (unpublished data). Therefore a cocktail of potent, broadly cross-neutralizing MAbs, like the one described elsewhere [2], will overcome neutralization escape and provide protection from disease after laboratory accidents, zoonotic introductions, or focal outbreaks of disease [18, 28].",

A residue at location 777, associated with epitopes involving residues 443, 460, 462, and 463, suggests long-range interactions within the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. We showed that neutralization escape comes with the cost of reduced viral fitness and propose the development of a broadly cross-neutralizing MAb cocktail to overcome the generation of escape variants. We propose that a cocktail of MAbs S227.14 and S230.15 is particularly robust, because these MAbs individually neutralize a broad panel of human and zoonotic SARS-CoV variants and select for escape mutations at different sites in the RBD, and because escape mutants are severely attenuated in aged animals.",
