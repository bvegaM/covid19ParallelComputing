            "text": "Isatis tinctoria L. (Brassicaceae), which is commonly known as woad, is a species with an ancient and well-documented history as an indigo dye and medicinal plant. Currently, I. tinctoria is utilized more often as medicinal remedy and also as a cosmetic ingredient. In 2011, I. tinctoria root was accepted in the official European phytotherapy by introducing its monograph in the European Pharmacopoeia. The biological properties of raw material have been known from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Over recent decades, I. tinctoria has been investigated both from a phytochemical and a biological point of view. The modern in vitro and in vivo scientific studies proved anti-inflammatory, anti-tumour, antimicrobial, antiviral, analgesic, and antioxidant activities. The phytochemical composition of I. tinctoria has been thoroughly investigated and the plant was proven to contain many valuable biologically active compounds, including several alkaloids, among which tryptanthrin, indirubin, indolinone, phenolic compounds, and polysaccharides as well as glucosinolates, carotenoids, volatile constituents, and fatty acids. This article provides a general botanical and ethnobotanical overview that summarizes the up-to-date knowledge on the phytochemistry and biological properties of this valuable plant in order to support its therapeutic potential. Moreover, the biotechnological studies on I. tinctoria, which mainly focused on hairy root cultures for the enhanced production of flavonoids and alkaloids as well as on the establishment of shoot cultures and micropropagation protocols, were reviewed. They provide input for future research prospects.",

Other uses such as treating iposideremic The root is cylindrical, slightly tortuous, externally greyish-yellow, or brownish-yellow, wrinkled longitudinally and lenticellate transversally, with rootlets or rootlet scars. Root stock slightly expanded, which exhibited dark green or dark brown petiole bases arranged in whorls, and dense tubercles. Basal leaves are oblong-lanceolate, entire to toothed, and long-petioled. Cauline leaves, which are narrower than basal and gradually reduced upwards, are simple, entire, sagittate, usually amplexicaul, with acute auricles. The flowers are gathered in a racemose inflorescence, with yellow petals, tetradynamous androecium, consisting of six stamens with two filaments shorter than the others. Fruits are pendulous siliques, oblong-obovate, or elliptic-obovate hairless or shortly hairy. This species is very variable, particularly in the size, shape, and hairiness of the silique [1, 2, 13, 24] .",

The latter was described for the first time by Fortune in 1846, and initially considered Plants 2020, 9, 298 4 of 40 as a distinct species. Afterward, some taxonomists have classified it as a variety of I. tinctoria [17] . Angelini et al. [25] reported that I. indigotica presents morphological, genetic, and physiological differences with respect to the European I. tinctoria, even though it is closely related to this one. The seedlings of both species develop a rosette in the first year of their cycle. The leaves I. indigotica show a glaucous instead of a shiny surface, which is rarely pubescent with a greater thickness and a more upright habit. The high degree of genetic diversity between the two species was confirmed by various studies [26, 27] . Despite this, I. indigotica is currently considered a synonym of I. tinctoria, and not a separate species, as confirmed by the consulted taxonomic databases known as The Plant List, International Plant Names Index (IPNI), and Tropicos. On the other hand, the Euro+Med PlantBase does not mention I. indigotica in the list of synonyms.",

When the leaves are damaged and exposed to air, precursors are submitted to enzymatic hydrolysis by \u03b2-d-glucosidase and \u03b2-glucuronidase. After cleavage of the O-glycosidic linkage, the indoxyl is released giving, in turn, indigo (blue indigoid pigments) through the oxidation process, and producing isatin as a side reaction thanks to an oxygen-rich environment. Eventually, the condensation of indoxyl with isatin produces indirubin (red indigoid pigment), whereas the condensation with dioxindole, coming from Isatan C, produces isoindirubin (red indigoid pigment) [44] .",

A mix of I. tinctoria young and older rosette leaves were submitted to three different post-harvest treatments: immediate shock freezing with liquid N 2 followed by freeze drying, air drying at room temperature, and drying in a thermostatic oven at 40 \u2022 C. The highest concentrations of isatans A and B were found in freeze dried leaf samples whereas the indican had the lowest amount. On the other hand, the other two treatments lead to high concentrations of indican and complete disappearance of isatans A and B. In all samples, the isatan B concentrations were lower than those of isatan A. These data and the enzymatic conversion of indican to isatan B underlined the biosynthetic pathway where isatan B derived from indican is, at the same time, a biogenetic precursor and degradation product of isatan A. Eventually, the production and amount of indigo precursors depend on the cultivars and harvest period, which also influenced the indigo dyes' composition [55] .",

Alkaloids I. tinctoria is an important source of two known indolic alkaloids called indigo and indirubin. The first one has a blue colour instead of the second one that has a red colour and both of them are extensively used to dye textiles, cosmetics, foods, and pharmaceutical preparations. The plant is not able to synthetize directly into the indigoid pigments, but it produces several precursors: indican, isatan A, isatan B, and isatan C ( Figure 2 ). When the leaves are damaged and exposed to air, precursors are submitted to enzymatic hydrolysis by \u03b2-D-glucosidase and \u03b2-glucuronidase. After cleavage of the O-glycosidic linkage, the indoxyl is released giving, in turn, indigo (blue indigoid pigments) through the oxidation process, and producing isatin as a side reaction thanks to an oxygenrich environment. Eventually, the condensation of indoxyl with isatin produces indirubin (red indigoid pigment), whereas the condensation with dioxindole, coming from Isatan C, produces isoindirubin (red indigoid pigment) [44] . The indigo precursors indicant as well as isatans B and C were detected by Maugard et al. [44] . in the acetone/acetic acid 1% v/v extracts of I. tinctoria young and old fresh leaves. Moreover, the number of indigo precursors in these samples was quantified by the same team, who established that isatan B was the major precursor. The concentration of indigo precursors was higher in the young, fresh leaves than in the oldest ones.",

Honda et al. [43] isolated and identified tryptanthrin from I. tinctoria dried rosette leaf chloroform extracts for the first time. Moreover, more than 70 Isatis samples of different origin were analysed and the tryptanthrin content in the leaves varied from 0.56 to 16.74 \u00d7 10 \u22123 % [57] . The tryptanthrin synthetic pathway is not known, but it is a product of the post-harvest process. Its formation is apparently favoured by the drying process and elevated temperature (40 \u00b0C) and, on the contrary, the lyophilization and fermentative conditions decreased its concentration [58] .

The enzyme hydrolyzes the glucose moiety into the main skeleton by giving isothiocyanates and, under certain conditions, this reaction may lead to other types of products like thiocyanates, indoles, epithionitriles, and nitriles [59] . These compounds are responsible for the bitter and pungent taste and for most of the biological activities of the glucosinolates such as anticancer, antioxidant, and antibacterial factors.",

In this model, the DMC extract (os, 150 mg/mL once/day, on days 17-23 by injection of the adjuvant) led to a significant reduction of paw oedema induced by injection of Mycobacterium butyricum. This effect did not result in a dose-dependency. A decreased joint damage, a reduction of tissular and articular inflammatory markers (oedema, cell infiltration, articular damage, pannus, cysts etc.), bone, and cartilage erosion was observed. Interestingly, the treatment over two weeks with a high dose of I. tinctoria extract did not determine macroscopic lesions of the rat gastric mucosa. The treatment did not cause a significant difference in tissue levels of COX-1 and COX-2, immunohistochemically determined. These results appear to disagree with those reported by Orberth\u00fcr et al. [29] where a preferential inhibition of COX-2 and a reduced expression of iNOS was observed. In vitro studies demonstrated that the DCM extract is able to inhibit both tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and IL-\u03b2 production in RAW 264,7 macrophages [64] . Thus, the anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic activity of I. tinctoria DCM extract highlighted in the arthritis and DTH models was related to the reduction of the production of these cytokines.",

In particular, the phosphorylation and activation of JAK2 and STAT3 was suppressed, and the STAT3 downstream genes including Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, Cyclin D1, Cyclin A, and Survivin were down-regulated.

Recently, the anti-proliferative properties of polar extracts obtained from I. tinctoria rosette leaves together with those from the cauline leaves and the flowers have been evaluated [47] . To achieve the separation of the polar compounds from the lipophilic ones, frozen and lyophilized plant material was sequentially extracted with dichloromethane and 70% methanol. I. tinctoria polar extracts showed anti-proliferative effects against the human anaplastic thyroid cancer ATC cell lines CAL-62, 8505C and C-643. Particularly, after 48 h of treatment, the basal leaf extract markedly inhibited the growth of CAL-62 cells, which caused nearly 85% reduction of viability at the highest tested dose (1 mg/mL). The significant anti-proliferative effects against ATC cell lines have been related to the flavonoids and the phenolic acids contained in the extracts, characterized by HPLC-PDA/ESI-MS. Another study published by the same authors confirmed that phenolics were mainly responsible for the observed activity. The anti-proliferative properties of the phenolic-rich fraction obtained from I. tinctoria cauline leaf polar extract has been demonstrated, which caused 80% and 65% growth inhibition in CAL-62 and 8505C cells, respectively, after 48 h of exposure at the maximum tested dose (0.1 mg/mL).

By contrast, Ullah and colleagues [85] recently reported the good anti-microbial properties of different extracts from I. tinctoria. In particular, the study concerned the evaluation of anti-microbial activity of fractions obtained from different parts of the plant (branches, flowers, leaves, and roots) by extraction with 14 different solvents, which was performed using a micro-titer plate method against seven bacterial and four fungal strains. The obtained results showed that the extracts displayed antibacterial activity, more elevated against Gram-positive strains (B. subtilis, M. luteus and Staphylococcus aureus). In many cases, it was higher than the antibiotic cefotaxime used as a positive control as well as antifungal activity (except for branches). In general, the leaves were found to be the best plant part and ethyl acetate, n-hexane, chloroform, and acetone as the most efficient solvents for the extraction of antimicrobial compounds.",

In a study carried out by Li et al.

Furthermore, the polysaccharides reduced the expression of the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-3 induced by the PR8/H1N1 virus.

Aimed at establishing the involvement of phenolic compounds in the antioxidant properties of I. tinctoria, recently, the polar extract obtained from the rosette leaves and also those from the cauline leaves and the flowers have been investigated by in vitro assays based on different mechanisms [47] . Lyophilized plant material was sequentially extracted with dichloromethane and 70% methanol in order to separate the polar compounds from the lipophilic ones. The polar extracts were found to possess good radical scavenging (DPPH test) and ferrous ions' chelating activities and moderate reducing power, and those from cauline leaves and flowers displayed better antioxidant efficacy than the rosette leaf extract. The calculated coefficient of determination (R 2 ) indicated that flavonoids were the phenolic compounds mainly involved in the observed antioxidant properties. Another study carried out by the same authors on the phenolic-rich fraction obtained from I. tinctoria cauline leaf polar extract confirmed that phenolics were mainly responsible for the good radical scavenging properties [46] . In particular, the activity has been mainly related to the flavonols detected in the fraction, which have all the essential structural elements for potent radical scavenging activity. Compared to flavone compounds, the flavonols contain more hydroxyl groups (one to six) among which the OH group at the C-3 position has a very high ability to scavenge the DPPH radical, such as quercetin and rutin, which are well-known potent antioxidants. Interestingly, these works have highlighted the antioxidant activity not only of the rosette leaves, which are commonly utilized for their medicinal properties, but also of the cauline leaves and the flowers, which indicates a broader range of usage possibilities for this relevant species.",

As apparent from the analysis of the latest scientific literature, the biotechnological studies on I. tinctoria are limited mainly to hairy root cultures. Interestingly, within the last four years, the teams of two researchers: Gai and Jiao from Northeast Forestry University, Harbin in China, have published a series of research publications on I. tinctoria hairy root cultures. The cultures were successfully initiated from in vitro petiole explants co-cultured with Agrobacterium rhizogenes with the addition of acetosyringone and arginine. In the obtained hairy root cultures, the high production of alkaloids [116] and flavonoids [117] was confirmed. Within the alkaloids epigoitrin, isatin, indole-3-carboxaldehyde, tryptanthrin, indigo, and indirubin were qualitatively and quantitatively determined by LC-MS/MS. The total alkaloid content (521.77 \u00b5g/g DW (dry weight)) was 1.12 times higher than in two-year-old roots of field grown plants (464.69 \u00b5g/g DW) [116] . Under the study on flavonoid composition, eight bioactive constituents were estimated by the LC-MS/MS method: rutoside, neohesperidin, buddleoside, liquiritigenin, quercetin, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, and isoliquiritigenin [117] . Under optimal conditions, the total flavonoid content (438.10 \u00b5g/g DW) was found to be 1.28 times higher than in two-year-old field grown roots (341.73 \u00b5g/g DW) analyzed for comparison. Additionally, in vitro antioxidant assays demonstrated that hairy root extracts exhibited higher activities than those from roots of field grown plants [117] .",

The elicitation experiment with chitosan was proven to increase the flavonoid yield in I. tinctoria hairy root biomass [118] . In comparison with the control (2.31 mg/g DW), a 7.08-fold enhancement of total flavonoids (16.35 mg/g DW) was achieved in 24-day-old hairy root cultures elicited by 150 mg/L chitosan for 36 h [118] . Under another study, the I. tinctoria hairy root cultures were exposed to ultraviolet radiation (UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C) in an attempt to promote the production flavonoids. Results showed that the maximum flavonoid accumulation (7259.12 \u00b5g/g DW) in hairy root cultures treated by 108 kJ/m 2 dose of UV-B radiation increased 16.51-fold as compared to the control (439.68 \u00b5g/g DW) [119] . Moreover, the same teams proved the increase of flavonoid production after I. tinctoria hairy root cultures co-cultivation with two immobilized live GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) fungi: Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus oryzae. A. niger strains were exhibited as the better biotic elicitor in the plant-fungus co-cultivation system. The highest flavonoid production (3018.31 \u00b5g/g DW) was achieved after treatment with spores at the concentration of ca.104 spores/mL, temperature of 30 \u2022 C, pH 7.0, and time of 72 h. The total amount of flavonoids increased 6.83 times in comparison to control hairy roots (441.91 \u00b5g/g DW) [120] . A recent work on elicitation of I. tinctoria hairy root cultures proved enhanced production of flavonoids as well as alkaloids after abiotic elicitation protocol applied with salicylic acid and methyl jasmonate [121] . As determined by central composite design based on a mathematical model, the maximum accumulation of alkaloids was found in biomass elicited by 142.61 \u00b5M salicylic acid for 28.18 h and flavonoids in biomass elicited by 179.54 \u00b5M methyl jasmonate for 41.87 h.
