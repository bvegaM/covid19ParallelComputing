            "text": "Emerging evidence supports the concept of two distinct types of disulfides in protein structures which have different functional roles.1 The best known group act as structural stabilizers in proteins, significantly lowering the Gibb's free energy of the protein chain by crosslinking it, resulting in proteins that are more resistant to denaturation. The second group are redox-active and best known for their catalytic role in proteins such as thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases. An increasing role for the redox-active group in protein redox regulation is emerging.1,2 These disulfides act as redox-sensitive switches and are best viewed as post-translational modifications akin to phosphorylation. It has now been established that oxidative regulation: important in processes such as the cell cycle, apoptosis, and response to oxidative stress; is an important control mechanism in the cytosol. Transient oxidation mediates control of enzymes, signaling pathways, as well as transcriptional and translational control. However, these characterized cytosolic proteins likely only represent the tip of the iceberg. Increasingly, reduction of disulfides is also emerging as a key regulator of protein function in oxidizing environments.3\u20135 Importantly, ageing and several major diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, type II diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease have been associated with abnormal redox conditions.",

Disulfide redox potentials measured in thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases range from \u2212120 to \u2212270 mV.6\u20139 For disulfides serving structural purposes, the redox potential can be as low as \u2212470 mV.10 Computational methods for distinguishing the two groups would be a boon. Reactivity of a redox-active Cys is modulated by its immediate protein environment. In addition to the effects of the electrostatic environment, physical stress applied to a disulfide bond both through stretching and twisting enhances its reactivity. These forces can be applied to a protein dynamically11 or may be captured during the protein folding process, rendering the disulfide poised to act upon exposure to variations in redox conditions.12 Because of their enhanced reactivity, redox-active disulfides are also more susceptible to cleavage/oxidation under nonphysiologic conditions. For instance, redox-active disulfides are prone to cleavage by synchrotron radiation during the process of X-ray structure determination.13\u201315 Other factors such as the pH of crystallization or the presence of mutations that change the electrostatic environment near a disulfide may also influence reactivity. Here, we mined the Protein Data Bank (PDB)16 for highly similar proteins that have been solved in multiple redox states, that is, disulfide-bonded in one structure and reduced in another. We present evidence that most of the disulfides present in our Redox Pairs dataset are likely to be physiologically redox-active. Many of the proteins have known thiol-based redox activity, while others have a high likelihood of thiol-based redox activity based on their involvement with redox processes. We also observed and classified types of conformational changes which occur during redox transitions.",

For 41 proteins, direct experimental evidence of redox activity for the particular disulfide was available (designated by \u201cK\u201d in Table S1, Supporting Information). The proteins belong to several major groups known to have redox activity. 11 unique Redox Pairs are associated with aerobic metabolism in eukaryotes or carbon fixation in plants (in groups D and E of Table S1); a further five are associated with maturation of proteins of these pathways (in groups E and G). Four Redox Pairs are associated with ion channel activity (group A): two of these, the chloride channel CLIC1 and the detoxification enzyme arsenate reductase, have known redox activity17,18; while a third, aquaporin, was recently implicated as a pore for the reactive oxygen species hydrogen peroxide, as part of the redox signaling process.19 Seven Redox Pairs are associated with the cell cycle, a process known to be redox regulated20 (Group B). Formation of disulfides involving the catalytic Cys in the phosphatases PR-1 and Cdc25B regulate their resident protein's function.21,22 41 Redox Pairs (group d) are involved in transcriptional control, replication, and DNA synthesis including the oxidative stress response transcription factor OxyR23 and ribonucleotide reductases from several species in multiple redox states.24 12 Redox Pairs generated or destroyed reactive oxygen species (Groups F and Y). The latter comprised three different peroxiredoxins25 as well as superoxide dismutases from several species.26 Four different amine oxidases generate peroxide while inducible nitric oxide synthase generates NO. Other large groups consist of proteins devoted to cell entry27 (Group b, 15 examples), cell adhesion (group c, nine examples), immunity (group f, 43 examples), apoptosis and protein fate (groups Z and a, 10 examples), and redox signaling (group X, 13 examples).

A further 65 proteins, designated by \u201cF\u201d in Table S1, contain disulfides in protein structures that disobey known rules of protein stereochemistry.37,38 These disulfides, which we refer to as \u201cforbidden\u201d disulfides, conform to canonical structural motifs. Deformation of the resident structure enhances disulfide reactivity by inducing stress in the protein chain.37,38 Forbidden disulfides are proposed to have a functional role through redox activity.12 In summary, a total of 226 proteins in the Redox Pair dataset contain disulfides predicted to be redox-active by a second independent bioinformatic analysis method.",

For the remaining structures where the metal atom is retained in the oxidized structure, the shortened SG-SG distance may be caused by a heterogeneous mix of oxidized and reduced, metal-bound structures in the ensemble. We reasoned that if the metal was expelled from some members of the ensemble, or partially expelled (still in the site but held, for example, by only two of four potential ligating Cys), then the B-factor should be higher than for chains where no shortened SG-SG distances are observed. Although B-factors cannot be compared between different structures, for some of the redox pairs, different chains of the same structure in different disulfide redox states could be compared. Our analysis confirmed that the B-factor of the metal was higher in the oxidized chains for 80% of structures (see Fig. 3). A similar result was obtained for proteins with Fe-S clusters. There were no instances of expulsion of the Fe-S cluster from the oxidized structure but oxidation of Fe-ligating Cys residues to form disulfides was generally associated with a higher B-factor of the relevant Fe atom than Fe atoms where the ligating Cys remained reduced.

Changes in pseudo-dihedral angles calculated using four consecutive C\u03b1 atoms exceeding a summed threshold of 1000 degrees over seven consecutive residues were used to detect changes in secondary structure. Twenty-two parents were found in the fully reduced set and four in the partially reduced set (designated m in Supporting Information Table 1). Proteins showing the largest conformational changes are in Table II. These proteins include the Cl\u2212 channel CLIC1: a protein that forms ion channels by inserting itself into membranes in response to oxidation; the detoxification enzyme arsenate reductase, which undergoes multiple conformational changes associated with a disulfide relay as part of its reaction cycle17,61 and cyclic phosphodiesterase, a tRNA-splicing enzyme where the disulfide modulates access to the active site.59 Like OxyR, several of these proteins exhibit large changes in C\u03b1 separations of the two Cys between alternate redox states (Table II). Thus large physical separation of the reduced Cys pair seems to be a common feature of many of these proteins and does not preclude disulfide formation.",

Inadvertent triggering of redox-active disulfide switches is a likely contributor to these phenotypes. This view is supported by the association of several Redox Pairs in the dataset with disease. SOD1 (also known as CuZn-SOD) is an enzyme mutated in familial lateral sclerosis (FALs), an age-dependent degenerative disorder of motor neurons in the spinal cord, brain stem and brain. SOD1 is largely localized to the cytosol but is also found in the intermembrane space of mitochondria. SOD1 is activated by formation of the disulfide and insertion of Cu by the copper carrier CCS. Both of these proteins are represented in the Redox Pair dataset (Tables I and S2). The conserved disulfide in SOD1 is essential for activity and unusual because it remains oxidized in the cytosol. Although the disulfide is intrachain, it is thought to play a critical role in stabilizing the SOD1 homodimer. Formation of the disulfide is part of the SOD1 maturation process which is regulated by physiological oxidative stress. The three reduced proteins in the dataset are three distinct mutants associated with familial lateral sclerosis (FALs): G37R, H46R, and I113T. The exclusive association of the reduced proteins with the disease mutants suggests redox imbalance of this disulfide is implicated in the disease. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that 14 FALs mutants have the common property of being more susceptible to disulfide reduction than wild-type protein.97 Toxicity associated with disulfide-linked multimerization of SOD1 mutants has recently been implicated in the disease mechanism.98",

Zn is not expelled from all protein Zn-binding sites with equal facility, and is probably not expelled from some sites at all under physiologic conditions. For structural Zn sites an analogous situation may exist to the bipartite distribution of redox-active and structural disulfides in proteins, with labile Zn sites being redox-active and inert Zn sites corresponding to the purely structural group. Key to Zn expulsion under oxidizing conditions is the presence of oxidation-prone Cys as a Zn ligand. Sites with more Cys are likely to be more facile. Based on the number and nature of ligands, the Zn sites detected in the Redox Pair dataset likely belong to the redox-active group.",

            "text": "The repeated association of forbidden disulfides of the BDD type with labile Zn binding sites is particularly interesting because of the recent characterization of the oxidative process that leads to activation of the bacterial chaperone Hsp33.99 The presence of the Zn center keeps Hsp33 monomeric and functionally inactive. Upon exposure to elevated temperatures, the C-terminal domain swings away from the protein's center of mass, exposing the Zn centre. The N-terminal thiols in the Zn site, Cys 232 and Cys 234, are preferentially oxidatively modified. The remaining two Cys, 269 and 272, form a disulfide of the BDD type, releasing Zn and unfolding the C-terminal domain. Unfolding the C-terminus removes a steric barrier to dimerization, activating the protein's chaperone function. The function of disulfide formation between Cys 269 and 272 in the Zn binding site has not been fully delineated. Potential benefits are protection from other oxidation modifications and restriction of the conformational freedom of the protein chain allowing easier refolding upon return of the protein's milieu to normal conditions. However, these benefits apply to any disulfide and the repeated appearance of the BDD in labile Zn sites of proteins of the Redox Pair dataset suggests a more specific function, possibly recognition by a foldase or metallochaperone. We hypothesize the forbidden disulfide would become stressed upon condensation of the \u03b2-sheet in its vicinity,12 possibly allowing easier re-insertion of Zn. Without any detailed experiments as a guide, the significance of the other repeated forbidden disulfide motif, the JSD, is not clear, but the same arguments relating to its forbidden disulfide nature would apply. The JSD-containing proteins MetH and BHMT are known to be reversibly inactivated by disulfide formation.100 In vitro, BHMT can be reactivated by dialysis against DTT and Zn,101 but the specific method of reactivation in vivo has not been characterized.",

The current paradigm, due to Anfinsen, is that the primary sequence of a protein encodes a unique three-dimensional structure. Various discoveries that have challenged this notion include the spectacular pH-induced conformational change in influenza A haemagglutinin (HA),105 molecular chaperones, and the previously discussed disordered sequences. All of these discoveries have been difficult to reconcile with the concept that protein sequences adopt a unique minimally frustrated fold. HA is believed to be kinetically trapped in a higher energy fold by an N-terminal domain which is subsequently cleaved, allowing it to cascade into a minimally frustrated fold. The conformations of disordered sequences appear to be principally governed by entropic factors: weak sequence preferences for a variety of conformational substates or modes appear to be co-selected by ligands. Morphing structures appear to be a new type of challenge to the concept of a unique minimally frustrated fold. For morphing sequences, the structure appears to be dependent on the environment. Unlike influenza A HA, where kinetic trapping during the folding process clearly plays a part in the structure adopting two different folds, for morphing sequences the two folds are energetic minima for the sequence in a particular environment. As such structural changes are reversible and dependent on environment.",

The most spectacular morphing transition is that of CLIC1, where an entire subdomain of the protein rearranges in response to different redox conditions. Several Redox Pairs were found exhibiting large morphing conformational transitions of similar magnitude to OxyR, supporting the notion that these types of transitions may be reasonably common. Large separations of the Cys residues in the reduced state are a typical feature of these proteins, and do not preclude disulfide linkages forming.

Large conformational changes between structure-pairs corresponding to rearrangements of the polypeptide backbone were also identified using an implementation of a method by Flocco and Mowbray.117 For pairs of structures, the method compares the change in a pseudo-torsional angles defined by four consecutive C\u03b1-atoms. Conformational changes were identified by running a smoothing window (five residues long) over the torsional-difference plot. Stretches of contiguous residues with seven or more pseudo-dihedral angles that exhibited individual movements in excess of 20\u00b0 were initially filtered from the dataset. These conformational changes were further classified by comparing DSSP annotations, solvent accessibility and secondary structure, between the protein pairs. Proteins with conformational changes where the summed changes in the pseudo-torsional angles exceeded a threshold of 1000 degrees with accompanying secondary structure changes were classified as morphing. The presence or absence of multiple chains in the PDB structure could cause errors when calculating changes in solvent accessibility; therefore, DSSP was run on individual chains only. All solvent accessibility measures were normalized using values derived by Chothia.118 Each amino acid was assigned to one of two states; core or exposed. Core residues are those with a solvent accessibility of less than 10% and exposed residues are those with a solvent accessibility equal to 10% or more. Secondary structures were assigned to one of three states: helix, strand and coil.",

The A subunit of spinach chloroplast GAPDH in a reduced, monomeric form (PDB 2hki) is shown on the right and the oxidized homotetramer in complex with NAD+ (PDB 1nbo) is shown on the left. In higher plants, photosynthetic GAPDH exists in vivo mainly as heteromeric isoforms, A2B2 and A8B8 being the most abundant, interconvertible conformations. The B subunit is homologous to the A subunit but has an additional nonhomologous C-terminal extension. Stable homotetramers of A subunits (A4-GAPDH) are found at low levels in chloroplast preparations and may be the only form of photosynthetic GAPDH present in unicellular green algae and cyanobacteria. Calvin cycle enzymes are known, as a group, to be redox regulated.85 The activity of the AB isoform of chloroplast GAPDH is redox regulated by formation of a disulfide between C-terminal thiols in the nonhomologous part of the B chain in light, and its reduction in the dark.86 The interchain disulfide between A subunits may be important for redox control of the A4 isoform, which is known to form complexes with the small chloroplast protein CP12 and phosphoribulosekinase in the dark.87 The disulfide-forming Cys 200 (1nbo numbering) is not present in the B subunit of chloroplast GAPDH which is transcribed from a different gene, or in cytosolic GAPDHs.
