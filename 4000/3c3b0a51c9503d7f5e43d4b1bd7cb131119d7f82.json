A few cases of symptomatic hyperammonemia after Roux-en-Y surgery have been reported in adults. 1 Salmonella enteritis as a common cause of infectious colitis and acute encephalopathy associated with nontyphoidal salmonellosis has been reported. Here, we introduce a child who suffered from hyperammonemic encephalopathy with Salmonella enteritis after Roux-en-Y surgery.",

Her liver function tests (albu- The specific mechanism underlying hyperammonemia after Rouxen-Y surgery remains unknown; however, some possible mechanisms have been identified. First, partial ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery has been proposed, which leads to impairment of the urea cycle, which in turn results in serum ammonia accumulation. Second, changes in the intestinal flora, which lead to increased ammonia production after the surgery, have also been proposed. Third, a catabolic state accelerating protein breakdown may also contribute to hyperammonemia. 1 In our case, hyperammonemia occurred 9 months after the Roux-en-Y surgery;",

Another interesting finding in this case was the Salmonella colitis, which has been associated with enteric hyperammonemia in equines in a previous study. 3 In addition, two human cases of acute encephalopathy associated with salmonellosis have been reported, but not associated with hyperammonemia. 4 This implies that Salmonella infection may be a possible trigger of hyperammonemic encephalopathy in patients after Roux-en-Y surgery, and further animal studies may help to elucidate the mechanism.",

The diagnosis was Salmonella enteritis with severe sepsis. Her fever gradually subsided by day 6 of admission. However, a change in consciousness occurred, and she suddenly became drowsy on admission day 7. Computed tomography imaging of the head revealed no evidence of an intracranial lesion. A cerebrospinal fluid culture was negative. Blood gas analysis, blood sugar, and electrolytes were all within normal limits. The electroencephalography (EEG) showed generalized continuous delta waves, indicating metabolic encephalopathy. The only reasonable cause of this consciousness change was the elevated serum ammonia level (639 \u03bcg/dL). The patient was treated with lactulose and neomycin, which normalized the serum ammonia level within 2 days. After the serum ammonia level had normalized (54 \u03bcg/dL), the patient's consciousness recovered to a normal (clear) condition.
