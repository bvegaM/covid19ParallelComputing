The genome contains several genes that encode structural and nonstructural proteins that are required for progeny virion production.1 The virion envelope surrounding the nucleocapsid contains the following structural proteins: S (spike) protein, M (membrane),and E (envelope). A third glycoprotein, HE (hemagglutinin-esterase), is present in most class II coronaviruses.8,9 A helical nucleocapsid exists in the center of the viral particle.10\u201312 Nucleocapsid protein, the major structural protein of CoVs, binds to the viral RNA genome to form the virion core, which leads to the formation of a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex or to a long helical nucleocapsid structure.13,14 The formation of the RNP is important for maintaining the RNA in an ordered conformation suitable for replication and transcription of the viral genome.13,15\u201317 Previous studies have shown that the CoV N protein is involved in the regulation of cellular processes such as gene transcription, actin reorganization, host cell cycle progression, and apoptosis.18\u201321 It has also been shown to act as an RNA chaperone.22 Moreover, the N protein is an important diagnostic marker and the most \u201cimmuno-dominant\u201d antigen in a host immune response.17,23,24",

As shown in Figure 1(A), the CD spectra of HCoV-OC43 N protein were scanned from 190 to 250 nm at 20, 45, 60, and 90\u00b0C. Analysis by the SELECON program revealed that HCoV-OC43 N protein contains \u223c35.1% \u03b1-helices, 11.6% \u03b2-sheets, 23.8% turns, and 29.5% random coils at room temperature. At high temperatures, the CD spectra of HCoV-OC43 N protein showed decreased intensity between 210 and 220 nm and a large negative peak at 190 nm, which are characteristic of disordered protein. Previous CD spectra of the full-length N proteins from SARS and 229E CoVs indicated that the N protein is relatively disordered and composed of \u223c50% nonsecondary structures.17 Our present results suggest that the conformations of HCoV-OC43 N proteins are more ordered than those of HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV N proteins [Fig. 1(A)]. We also measured the melting temperature (Tm) of HCoV-OC43 N proteins using CD [Fig. 1(B)]. Heat denaturation analysis showed that the Tm of HCoV-OC43 N protein is 52\u00b0C under our conditions. The thermal denaturation of HCo-OC43 N protein is reversible (data not shown).",

These domain boundaries are based on the PONDR predictions [Fig. 4(A)]. The binding of each truncated N protein to RNA was analyzed by SPR [Fig. 4(B)]. These studies showed that the N-terminal domain (N1\u2013173) and the central-linker region (N174\u2013232 and N233\u2013300), but not the C-terminal domain, bound to RNA [Fig. 4(B)]. The kinetic constants for association (ka in M\u22121 s\u22121) and dissociation (kd in s\u22121) of the truncated N proteins with respect to singled-stranded RNA have been calculated and listed in Table I.

Unlike SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E N proteins, the recombinant HCoV-OC43 N protein is highly resistant to proteolysis.17 According to previous heat and urea denaturation analyses, the Tm and Cm values of SARS-CoV N protein are 38\u00b0C and 2.77 M, respectively, implying a low stability of the SARS-CoV N protein.45 In this work, the Tm and Cm of the HCoV-OC43 N protein were found to be 52\u00b0C and 4 M, respectively. Our results suggest that the HCoV-OC43 N protein is more stable than the SARS-CoV N protein.45",

This binding demonstrates that the obtained recombinant N protein was properly folded. We examined the binding of recombinant HCoV-OC43 protein for nucleic acids. Our kinetic data showed that HCoV-OC43 N protein binds preferentially to single-stranded RNA over the corresponding single-stranded DNA. The decreased affinity for DNA may be due to two factors. First, the 2\u2032-hydroxyl group of ribose in RNA may form hydrogen bonds with residues of the N protein. Second, in DNA, the methyl group on the C5 of thymine may create a steric clash with residues within the RNA-binding groove. The Hiscox group suggested that phosphorylation of the N protein determined the recognition of virus RNA because phosphorylation may alter the conformation of N protein, and thus affect its RNA-binding sites.12,33,34 In addition, Mohandas et al. have reported that dephosphorylation of MHV N protein by cellular phosphoprotein phosphatase may facilitate the infectious process.46 However, the role of phosphorylation in the RNA-binding sites of HCoV-OC43 N protein was not investigated in our study because the N protein was expressed in E coli. It would be interesting to study the effects of phosphorylation on the conformation and RNA-binding properties of HCoV-OC43 N protein in the future.",

It has a U-shaped structure with the two arms rich in basic residues and the flexible loops well-ordered around the \u03b2-sheet core of the N-terminal domain.26,36 Spencer and Hiscox found that the N-terminal region of IBV protein facilitates long-range, nonspecific interactions between N protein and viral RNA, thus leading to the formation of the ribonucleocapsid via a lure and lock mechanism.29 Similar to the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV and IBV N proteins, the N-terminal domain of HCoV-OC43 N protein contains many positively charged residues and has been shown by SPR to be responsible for RNA binding. In addition to the N-terminal domain (N1\u2013173), two highly positively charged portions of the central linker region, N174\u2013232 and N233\u2013300, also show RNA-binding activity. Given their high pI values, these RNA-binding regions may rely on electrostatic interactions to interact with RNA. Compared with N1\u2013173 and N233\u2013300, N174\u2013232 has lower RNA-binding affinity and, therefore, appears to play an auxiliary role in RNA binding, despite the presence of a serine/arginine motif (SR-rich motif) that is usually involved in RNA recognition.48 In a previous study, the SR-rich motif of MHV N protein was shown to be the RNA-binding region.28,42 In addition, the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV N protein has been proposed to bind nucleic acids and to participate in genomic RNA-binding.25,49 However, our studies suggest that the C-terminal domain (N301\u2013448) of the HCoV-OC43 N protein does not bind RNA.",

These oligomers exist predominantly as dimers.44,50 The N-terminal domain allows for the association of dimers to form higher-order oligomers. Crystal structures of the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV and IBV N proteins show a similar general polypeptide fold, which strongly suggests that the dimerized N protein is the functional unit in vivo for the four groups of coronaviruses.27,35 The crystal structure of the C-terminal domain shows a tightly intertwined, twofold symmetric C-terminal domain dimer with a \u03b2-hairpin (\u03b21 and \u03b22) from one subunit extending into the cavity of the opposite subunit; this forms an antiparallel \u03b2-sheet with hydrogen bonds across the dimer interface. Luo et al.49 have reported that this dimer association does not involve electrostatic forces. These authors have further suggested that the SR-rich motif of the SARS-CoV N protein binds to the central region and thereby triggers the multimerization of dimers.51 In addition, Fan et al. showed that the N-terminal region of the IBV N protein is involved in the oligomerization of N protein.26 Here, we analyzed the self-association properties of the HCoV-OC43 N protein and found it to form oligomers. We identified the C-terminal 148 amino acids of HCoV-OC43 N protein to be the oligomerization domain. When expressed in isolation, this region of the C-terminus formed oligomers at only micromolar concentrations, and this oligomerization occurred in the absence of the N-terminal domain. The other truncated constructs of HCoV-OC43 N protein, N1\u2013173 and N174\u2013232, were found to remain as monomers under all of the tested experimental conditions, suggesting that these two regions are not involved in oligomerization during ribonucleocapsid formation.",

The surface was first washed three times by injecting 10 \u03bcL of 100 mM NaCl solution with 50 mM NaOH. To control the amount of RNA (or DNA) bound to the SA chip surface, the biotinylated oligomer was immobilized manually onto the surface of a streptavidin chip until a signal of 1200 RU was achieved in the first cell. The chip surface was then washed with 10 \u03bcL of 10 mM HCl to eliminate non-specific binding. The second flow cell was unmodified and served as a control. The appropriate N proteins were dissolved in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.3) with 150 mM NaCl and 0.1% CHAPS, and passed over the chip surface for 140 s at a flow rate of 30 \u03bcL/min to reach equilibrium. Blank buffer solution was then passed over the chip to initiate the dissociation reaction; this step was continued for an additional 600 s to complete the reaction. After 600 s, the surface was recovered by washing with 10 \u03bcL of 0.1% SDS for each single-stranded RNA (or DNA). Before fitting to the 1:1 Langmuir model, binding data were corrected by subtraction of the control to account for simple refractive index differences. Sensorgrams for interactions between RNA (or DNA) and protein were analyzed using BIA evaluation software (version 3). To verify if mass transport effects may arise during the interaction between N protein and immobilized RNA, binding experiments were performed at different flow rates and different surface binding capacity. It was found that the binding interaction between N protein and RNA is not a mass transport-limited process because the derived kinetic parameters (especially the association rate constant, ka) are independent of the flow rate and binding capacity.",
