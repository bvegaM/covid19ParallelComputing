            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a severe form of pneumonia. Its transmission pattern, high mortality rate and possible re-emergence in the future make SARS a serious threat for which neither efficient therapy nor vaccine is currently available. The disease is caused by a member of the coronavirus family: the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV; Fouchier et al., 2003 \u25b6). Following viral entry into cells, two polyproteins named pp1a and pp1ab, with molecular weights of 486 and 790 kDa, respectively, are synthesized (Rota et al., 2003 \u25b6). During the viral life cycle, pp1a and pp1ab are processed into 15 putative non-structural proteins by two viral proteases: the papain-like protease and the main proteinase Mpro (also named the 3C-like protease; 3CLpro; reviewed in Ziebuhr et al., 2000 \u25b6). In SARS-CoV, Mpro is responsible for the cleavage of 11 sites in the replicase polyproteins (Snijder et al., 2003 \u25b6), releasing viral enzymes needed for replication, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the helicase, as well as other accessory proteins and non-structural proteins the functions of which are not fully understood. Thus, given its pivotal role in the viral life cycle, Mpro is an attractive target for the development of drugs directed against the SARS virus. Three-dimensional structures of Mpro enzymes have been reported for several coronaviruses including human CoV (HCoV229E; Anand et al., 2003 \u25b6), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV; Anand et al., 2002 \u25b6) and SARS-CoV (Yang et al., 2003 \u25b6). In this study, using an Escherichia coli overexpression system, we purified the SARS-CoV Mpro and obtained a novel crystal form at pH 6.5 that diffracts to high resolution and contains one monomer per asymmetric unit. The active-site residues and the oxyanion hole adopt a functional conformation, indicating that this crystal form might be useful for structure-based drug design.",

The forward primer (5\u2032-TACTAATTGAAGGAGTTCGGGTTTTAGGAAAATGG-3\u2032) contains an XmnI site (bold). The reverse primer (5\u2032-AGCCGGATCCTTATTGGAAGGTAACACCAG-3\u2032) contains a BamHI site (bold) downstream of the stop codon TAA. Four additional amino acids (IEGR) were introduced to facilitate the removal of MBP by factor Xa. Transformed BL21(DE3) E. coli cells were grown at 310 K in LB media supplemented with 0.2% glucose until an OD600nm of 0.6\u20130.8 was attained. IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mM and the temperature was lowered to 303 K. After 2 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000g for 10 min, resuspended in buffer A (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) and lysed by sonication for 20 min, followed by centrifugation at 20 000g for 20 min at 277 K. The supernatant was loaded onto an Econo-column (Bio-Rad) packed with amylose resin (New England Biolab) equilibrated with buffer A and incubated overnight at 277 K. The fusion protein was eluted at 277 K using 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM maltose and loaded onto a HiPrep 16/10 Q Sepharose FF column (Amersham) equilibrated with buffer B (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). Proteins were eluted using a linear NaCl concentration gradient in buffer C (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8.0, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). Fractions containing MBP-SARS-CoV Mpro were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration at 3000g (Centricon, Vivascience) and desalted in 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2 using PD-10 columns (Amersham). One unit of factor Xa was added per 142 \u00b5g of fusion protein for 6 h at 297 K. After cleavage, factor Xa was removed using a resin (Qiagen). Cleaved products were loaded onto an XK 16/20 phenyl Sepharose resin column (Amersham) equilibrated in buffer D (12.5 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA). The recombinant SARS-CoV Mpro was eluted using buffer E (12.5 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 7.0, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA). Fractions containing SARS-CoV Mpro were pooled and the buffer changed to 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT for concentration to 5 mg ml\u22121 as determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) with BSA as a standard and stored at 193 K.",

            "text": "The model comprises one monomer per asymmetric unit (residues 1\u2013301). Five residues from the C-terminus are not visible in the electron-density map and have been omitted. Residues 1\u2013101 (domain I) and 102\u2013184 (domain II) form the chymotrypsin-like double-\u03b2-barrel structure which is observed in several viral proteases including picornaviruses, togaviruses and flaviviruses (Babe & Craik, 1997 \u25b6). The C-terminal \u03b1-helical domain (residues 201\u2013301) of SARS-CoV Mpro is required for activity, since a truncated fragment comprising only its catalytic domain displays a significant decrease in enzymatic activity (Bacha et al., 2004 \u25b6). Structural and functional studies of coronavirus Mpro have shown that dimerization is required for maximal protease activity. In this respect, a prominent role is played by the seven amino-terminal amino acids, which adopt an extended conformation making extensive contacts with domain II of the other monomer and ensuring the formation of a catalytically competent active site (Yang et al., 2003 \u25b6). In our crystal form, the active dimer is generated through the crystallographic twofold. No contact is established by Ser1, which is mobile as shown by a higher than average temperature factor. The path of the main chain, however, closely follows that observed in previously reported active monomers, with an r.m.s deviation of 0.80 \u00c5 for 300 equivalent main-chain atoms (PDB code 1uj1 chain A; Yang et al., 2003 \u25b6) (Fig. 1 \u25b6\na). This latter crystal form belongs to space group P21 and contains one dimer in the asymmetric unit with quasi-twofold symmetry. This indicates that the N-terminal residue is not absolutely required for the active site to adopt an active conformation.",

The catalytic Cys145-His41 dyad (with the cysteine thiol acting as the nucleophile) is used instead of the classical Ser-His-Asp triad of serine proteases (Fig. 1 \u25b6\nb). Although the crystals were obtained at pH 6.5, a value which is presumably near the pK\na value of His residues in the substrate-binding site and where the enzyme shows a slightly reduced activity, the conformation of the active site indicates an active enzyme (Fig. 1 \u25b6\nb). The immediate vicinity of the active site is involved in extensive intermolecular contacts with neighbouring molecules. Thus, this crystal form is likely to be more suitable for studies involving soaking or co-crystallization of small compounds rather than long peptides.

(2003 \u25b6) (shown in blue, PDB code 1uj1, chain A). A residual rotation of 4.5\u00b0 is needed to then bring the two equivalent monomers B into coincidence. The active-site residues of each monomer are represented as sticks. (b) Detailed view of the active site represented as green sticks (2c3s, this work) superimposed onto the active monomer A of SARS-CoV Mpro (1uj1, chain A). The putative hydrogen bonds (dashed lines) formed by the spatially conserved water molecule (red sphere) are shown.",
