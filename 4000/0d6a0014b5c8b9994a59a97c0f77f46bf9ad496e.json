Despite this, genetic material correlating with HPV types 5, 10, 49, and 92 was recovered. In addition, other nonenveloped pathogens such as merkel cell polyomavirus and rhinovirus were also isolated (see Table 1 ). HPV is extremely stable in the environment due to its nonenveloped structure, resistance to heat, desiccation, and ability to viably persist for at least 7 days. 1 It can survive on a variety of surfaces from ultrasound probes to clothing. 2 It is resistant to common disinfectants, remaining infectious despite application of quaternary ammonium compounds (e.g. wipes containing ammonium chlorides), 3 Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 1 70% and 95% ethanol, 95% isopropanol, 3.4% glutaraldehyde, 0.55% ortho-phthalaldehyde, phenol, and 0.25% peracetic acid-silver. Only 0.525% hypochlorite (1:10 bleach dilution) and 1.2% peracetic acid-silver-based disinfectants have been shown to reduce infectivity by more than 99.99%. 4 The impact of this inadequacy of cleaning solutions transcends the development of mere cutaneous verrucae. HPV has been implicated as an oncovirus in the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and at least one of the viruses (HPV 5) in this study has been shown to be associated with increased risk for SCC. 5 Merkel cell polyomavirus, an oncovirus implicated in Merkel Cell Carcinoma, was also isolated from the clippers in significant quantity. The isolation of the virus from barbershop equipment has not been documented previously.",
