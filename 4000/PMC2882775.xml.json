The coronaviruses have been divided into three distinct groups on the basis of genome organization and phylogenetic analysis (Siddell, 1995 \u25b6). They are a family of enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses and include human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E, group 1), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV, group 2), murine hepatitis virus (MHV, group 2) and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV, group 3) (Sawicki et al., 2007 \u25b6). IBV is a prototype of coronavirus group 3 and causes significant losses in the global poultry industry (Cavanagh, 2003 \u25b6; Ignjatovic & Sapats, 2000 \u25b6). Insights into the replication/translation machinery of IBV may have important longer term consequences for the poultry industry.",

            "text": "The members of the coronavirus family have the largest RNA genomes known to date. The entire genome of IBV contains a positive-stranded ssRNA of 27 608 nucleotides, which encodes eight structural proteins and a set of nonstructural proteins that are crucial for viral RNA replication. The nonstructural proteins (nsps) are initially synthesized as two large polyproteins: pp1a and pp1ab. The two polyproteins are proteolytically processed into 15 nonstructural proteins (nsp2\u2013nsp16) by papain-like protease (PLP) and 3C-like protease (3CL Mpro). nsp2\u2013nsp11 are derived from pp1a and nsp12\u2013nsp16 from pp1ab (Brierley et al., 1987 \u25b6). Nsp9 has been proposed to be essential for viral RNA synthesis and replication based on deletion experiments in MHV (Deming et al., 2007 \u25b6) and the determination of the crystal structures of nsp9 from SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E also revealed its important function. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV (group 2) nsp9 revealed that the protein exists as a dimer and functions as a single-stranded RNA-binding protein (Egloff et al., 2004 \u25b6; Sutton et al., 2004 \u25b6). Although the HCoV-229E (group 1) nsp9 exhibits a different dimerization mode from that of SARS-CoV nsp9 because of a disulfide bond, it also binds strongly to single-stranded RNA (Ponnusamy et al., 2008 \u25b6). Subsequently, the dimerization and RNA-binding activity of IBV (group 3) nsp9 protein have been identified by immunoprecipitation, gel filtration, chemical cross-linking and Northwestern blotting (Chen et al., 2009 \u25b6). Biochemical data and the reverse-genetics approach indicated that the dimerization of SARS-CoV nsp9 is not critical for RNA binding but is necessary for viral replication (Miknis et al., 2009 \u25b6). Additionally, it has been proposed that the nsp9 might interact specifically with the stem-loop II motif (s2m) to stabilize nascent nucleic acids during RNA synthesis (Egloff et al., 2004 \u25b6; Robertson et al., 2005 \u25b6).",

The gene encoding IBV nsp9 (corresponding to Asn3675\u2013Gln3785 of the ORF1a polyprotein; Boursnell et al., 1987 \u25b6) was amplified by PCR from the cDNA with the primer pair 5\u2032-CGGGATCCAATAATGAGCTTATGCCACATGG\u00adTGTT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CCGCTCGAGTTACTGTAAGACAACAACATT\u00adAG-3\u2032. The PCR product was then inserted between the BamHI and XhoI sites of the pGEX-6p-1 plasmid (GE Healthcare) using T4 ligase. After confirming the sequence, the recombinant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. The culture was grown at 310 K in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (0.1 mg ml\u22121) until the cell density reached an OD600 of 0.6. Expression of the recombinant gene was induced by the addition of 0.4 mM isopropyl \u03b2-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 289 K for 16 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and then lysed by mild sonication in 1\u00d7PBS (phosphate-buffered saline; 140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4 and 1.8 mM KH2PO4 pH 7.3) at 277 K. After sonication, the lysate was centrifuged at 12 000g for 30 min and the supernatant containing the recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins was collected. The supernatant was then applied onto a Glutathione Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) column to remove impurities, followed by on-bead digestion with PreScission protease (2 U enzyme per 100 \u00b5g of bound GST-fusion protein) at 277 K for 16 h. The protease cleaved the GST from the fusion protein, with five additional residues (GPLGS) remaining at the N-\u00adterminus of IBV nsp9. The protein was concentrated to 0.5 ml using Thermo iCON concentrators and applied onto a Superdex 75 10/30 gel-filtration column (GE Healthcare) for further purification. The buffer for gel filtration contained 20 mM MES pH 6.5, 150 mM NaCl.",
