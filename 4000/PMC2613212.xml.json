Although the primary function of this prominent nuclear organelle is in ribosome biogenesis, a growing body of evidence indicates that it also participates in other aspects of RNA processing, as well as in the regulation of mitosis, cell growth and death, stress responses and the cell cycle (Fig 1). Indeed, the nucleolus has emerged as a highly complex and multifunctional regulatory compartment, the roles of which in diverse biological processes we are only just beginning to understand.",

His group have designed a \u2018spatial proteomics' protocol to characterize the protein content of the nucleolus, nucleoplasm and cytoplasm at a single given time, which involves a combination of stable isotope-labelling of amino acids in culture with cell fractionation and quantitative mass spectrometry. The Lamond group has used this method to quantitate the localization of approximately 3,000 cellular proteins and their transport in response to the induction of the nucleolar tumour-suppressor protein, ARF.

During mitosis, the nucleolus disassembles and the components of the rRNA transcription complex migrate with ribosomal genes, while the processing machinery is distributed at the chromosome periphery (Hernandez-Verdun, 2006). At exit from mitosis, processing proteins form a complex in pre-nucleolar bodies (PNBs), which are then recruited to the sites of rRNA transcription, and new nucleoli are formed (Angelier et al, 2005). D. Hernandez-Verdun (Paris, France) described the transport of photoactivatable green fluorescent protein (paGFP)-tagged processing proteins, such as B23, NOP52 and fibrillarin, between PNBs and nucleoli during nucleolar assembly. The late processing protein B23, when activated in the nucleolus, was found to feed back rapidly to PNBs, whereas the early processing protein fibrillarin did not relocate to PNBs within the time frame of the experiment. The differential sorting of early and late processing proteins might explain the difference in the timing of recruitment to the DFC and the GC. D. Hernandez-Verdun and M. Olson both described the presence of pre-rRNA transcripts in PNBs, and suggested that the existence of these transcripts in both nucleoli and PNBs allows an equilibrium of late processing proteins to form between the two compartments.",

The components of the small subunit (SSU) processing complex known as tUTPs are required for the efficient transcription of pre-rRNA in humans, suggesting that there is a coupling of rRNA transcription and processing. B. McStay (Galway, Ireland) and colleagues used pseudo-NORs\u2014which are transcriptionally silent artificial DNA arrays that bind to upstream binding factors (UBFs) and mimic the specialized chromatin structure of NORs\u2014to investigate the recruitment of processing factors to NORs in the absence of transcription. They found that tUTPs\u2014but not other components of the SSU processing complex\u2014and the pre-RNA processing factors Treacle, TCOF1 and NOPP140 are recruited to pseudo-NORs in a UBF-dependent manner (Prieto & McStay, 2007).

            "text": "Ribosomal gene transcription is regulated by modulation of the transcriptional apparatus and by epigenetic silencing. H. Bierhoff (Heidelberg, Germany) demonstrated that the PolI co-factor TIF-1A is phosphorylated by CK2 in response to external signals, and that this disrupts the interaction of TIF-1A with PolI, promoting the elongation of pre-rRNA transcripts and cell proliferation (Bierhoff et al, 2008). In Arabidopsis, silencing at rRNA repeats involves small interfering RNA (siRNA)-directed DNA methylation. C. Pikaard (Washington, DC, USA) showed that the 24-nucleotide (nt) siRNAs required for this process are generated in Cajal body-like nucleolar dots that he termed nucleolar siRNA-processing centres (Pontes et al, 2006). Pikaard also presented data demonstrating that in interspecies genetic hybrids, in which only one set of rRNA genes is active (a phenomenon known as nucleolar dominance), these 24-nt siRNAs bind to intergenic spacer regions of the non-active rRNA genes and are required for epigenetic silencing. He suggested that the siRNAs afford sequence specificity to de novo DNA methylation at these regions. In mammalian cells, the epigenetic silencing of rDNA involves the nucleolar remodelling complex (NoRC). Analogous to the situation in Arabidopsis, NoRC-mediated silencing requires 100\u2013350 nt RNA molecules, which originate from an intergenic spacer region upstream of the pre-RNA promoter (pRNA) and form a conserved stem\u2013loop structure (Mayer et al, 2006). I. Grummt (Heidelberg, Germany) showed that the secondary structure of pRNA is crucial for binding to TIP5, which is the large subunit of NoRC, targeting NoRC to nucleoli and facilitating rRNA gene silencing. Grummt also demonstrated that TIP5 acetylation is required for its silencing functions, although the interaction between pRNA and TIP5 is impaired by this post-translational modification. She presented a model to reconcile these data that involved acetylation-mediated displacement of pRNA on binding of TIP5 to chromatin (Fig 2).",

Tollervey (Edinburgh, UK) demonstrated that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, non-coding RNAs from rDNA intergenic spacer regions (such as IGS1-R) are targets for exosome-mediated degradation. Trf4, which is a component of the TRAMP4 complex, the exosome protein Mtr3, the nuclear-specific exosome component Rrp6, and the RNA-binding proteins Nrd1 and Nab3 are required for this degradation. Tollervey also demonstrated a role for the 5\u2032 exonuclease Rat1 in efficient transcription termination of rRNA genes.

Interestingly, mutations in SSU processome proteins are linked to several diseases, including male infertility and childhood cirrhosis; however, little is known about how the SSU processome is assembled. S. Baserga (New Haven, CT, USA) focused on the architecture of one of the bUTP subcomplexes of the SSU processome using S. cerevisiae as a model system. She presented a comprehensive map of interactions between six proteins within the subcomplex, and defined a crucial role of the interaction between UTP6 and UTP21 for its function. She also showed that the amino-terminal domain of UTP6 interacts with UTP18, whereas the UTP6 HAT domain interacts with UTP21. Mutational analysis of the UTP6 HAT domain indicated that the latter interaction is essential for pre-rRNA processing and cell growth (Champion et al, 2008). N. Watkins (Newcastle, UK) found that in humans, the box B/C motif of U3 snoRNP is essential for recruitment into the SSU processome, and both the box B/C motif and the 3\u2032 hinge are needed for binding to the MPP10 complex and subsequent localization to the GC. In further studies, Watkins found that the inhibition of rRNA transcription and/or processing\u2014using actinomycin D or tUTP depletion\u2014resulted in the accumulation of a new 50S U3 snoRNP-processing intermediate. The 50S complex contains nucleolin but no other crucial SSU factors, and is located in the DFC where processing takes place. He concluded that tUTP is required for the recruitment of this crucial intermediate into the SSU processome.",

Brown (Dundee, UK) demonstrated a role for the plant nucleolus in messenger RNA (mRNA) surveillance and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) by showing that there are similar amounts of total mRNA in the nucleoplasmic and nucleolar compartments, but that aberrantly spliced mRNAs are enriched in the nucleolar fractions. Most of these aberrant transcripts contain premature termination codons, which are generally the target of NMD. Consistent with the hypothesis that NMD takes place in the Arabidopsis nucleolus, it was found that UPF2 and UPF3, which are core components of the functional NMD complex, localize to this compartment. Furthermore, the expression of mutated forms of UPF2 and UPF3 induces the nucleolar accumulation of aberrantly spliced mRNA. This work provides evidence for a new nucleolar function in plants, and raises interesting questions about the pathway of NMD, and about where and how mRNA surveillance occurs in this species.",

These proteins were also used to construct chimeric proteins in which the NoLS was replaced with that of another virus (Emmott et al, 2008), which allowed Hiscox to show that NoLSs are responsible for distinct nucleolar localizations and transport rates. Nuclear import/export rates also contribute to nucleolar localization: the rapid nuclear import and slower nuclear export of the N protein explain its nucleolar localization. D. Matthews (Bristol, UK) focused on the nucleolar localization of the viral proteins that are encoded by adenoviruses. He showed that three adenoviral proteins, pMu, Protein V and pVII, are targeted to the nucleolus, and he identified their NoLSs. In addition, he showed that Protein V regulates the ARF, HDM2, p53 pathway by initiating a decrease in ARF levels and the misdistribution of HDM2. As Protein V is a component of incoming virus particles, Matthews speculated that it might have an opportunity to affect the host cell immediately after the virus has gained entry.",

He showed that the ability of the GRV ORF3 protein to move viral RNA long distances through the phloem\u2014the specialized plant-transport system\u2014depends strictly on its interaction with fibrillarin. The ORF3 protein enters the nucleolus, where it forms complexes with fibrillarin that are relocalized to the cytoplasm at a later stage. In the cytoplasm these complexes interact with viral RNA to form viral RNP that is able to move long distances (Canetta et al, 2008). A. Whitehouse (Leeds, UK) showed that \u03b3-2 herpesviruses also use the nucleolus for viral mRNA transport. The ORF57 protein that is encoded by these viruses is able to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, bind to viral mRNA, and interact with various nuclear import and export factors. Moreover, this protein is responsible for the relocalization of some nuclear export factors into the nucleolus, in particular the hTREX proteins; this indicates that the ORF57 protein either assembles the export-competent viral RNP particle within the nucleolus, or travels through the nucleolus to modify these proteins or the viral mRNA. M. Lymberopoulos (Laval, Canada) also demonstrated the redistribution of several nucleolar proteins during infection with another herpesvirus, herpes simplex virus 1. However, the mechanisms of such redistribution are distinct for different nucleolar proteins.",

S. Ogushi (Kobe, Japan) and colleagues set out to determine whether this nucleolar material contributes to embryogenesis (Ogushi et al, 2008). In an elegant series of experiments that involved removing the nucleolus from mouse oocytes, they showed that the zygotic nucleolus is maternally inherited and is essential for further embryonic development. They also revealed that this nucleolar material is in some way special, as embryonic development progressed when the oocytes were reconstituted with oocyte nucleoli but not with nucleoli from somatic cells.",

Milner (York, UK) examined the effects of RNA interference-induced silencing of the cell-survival genes SIRT1, JNK2 and p53 under basal non-stress conditions of cell growth. Mammalian SIRT1 is an NAD-dependent deacetylase with crucial roles in the maintenance of homeostasis and cell survival. Elevated levels of SIRT1 protein are evident in cancer, where it is thought to act as a survival factor. JNK2 and p53 are cell-survival proteins that are known to participate individually in the nucleolar response to metabolic, ribotoxic and genotoxic stress. Milner demonstrated that the levels of SIRT1 protein are increased in cancer cells owing to increased protein stability, which is dependent on JNK2. A comparison of isogenic clones of p53+/+ and p53\u2212/\u2212 HCT116 cells revealed that p53 is also involved in this process (Ford et al, 2008).",

            "text": "NPM (B23) is a nucleolar protein that binds to p53 and ARF, and is crucial for ribogenesis, cell proliferation and survival after DNA damage (Mariano et al, 2006). Mutations in the NPM gene are observed in approximately 35% of acute myeloid leukaemias and are thought to be an initiating event in tumorigenesis, although the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. NPM usually shuttles between the nucleolus, nucleoplasm and cytoplasm, and acts as a molecular chaperone. However, a de novo nuclear-export signal is generated by mutation of NPM that causes cytoplasmic localization of the protein. E. Colombo (Milan, Italy) and colleagues generated an NPM-null mouse that showed widespread DNA damage, apoptosis, massive p53 activation, ARF instability and gross developmental abnormalities, resulting in lethality (Colombo et al, 2005). Therefore, NPM seems to ensure DNA integrity, and to regulate the localization and stability of ARF, thereby contributing to tumorigenesis. Colombo also demonstrated that NPM binds to Fbw7\u03b3, which is a component of the c-Myc ubiquitin ligase complex, and that this interaction is required for the nucleolar localization and stability of Fbw7\u03b3 (Bonetti et al, 2008). In cells lacking NPM, the interaction is lost, and leads to the degradation of Fbw7\u03b3 and the stabilization of c-Myc, which is a phenotype also observed in cells expressing mutant NPM. As Fbw7\u03b3 is important in the regulation of other growth-promoting proteins, Colombo suggested that this interaction might be a crucial tumour-suppressor mechanism in human cancer.",

By contrast, RelA remains nucleoplasmic in response to the cytokine TNF and inhibits apoptosis (Fig 3). L. Stark (Edinburgh, UK) and colleagues are examining the signals that regulate the nuclear distribution of RelA. She presented data describing a role for the post-transcriptional modification of RelA in the translocation of the protein from the nucleoplasm to the nucleolus. Hiscox could target RelA to the nucleolus in the absence of external stimuli using a viral NoLS tag, and suggested that this could be used to induce cancer cell death.",

Le Bras (Paris, France) pointed out the crucial links between PML bodies, the nucleolus and senescence. Under several types of stress, endogenous PML proteins form nucleolar caps and eventually engulf nucleolar components. Only two specific PML splice variants, PML-I and PML-IV, are efficiently targeted to the nucleolus, and the abundant PML-I isoform is required for the targeting of endogenous PML proteins to this organelle. Spontaneous or oncogene-retrieval-induced senescence is associated with the formation of large PML nuclear bodies that initially contain nucleolar components. Later, poly-ubiquitin conjugates are found on the outer shell or within most of these senescence-associated PML bodies.",

Therefore, the rDNA selectivity of DNA damage-induced transcriptional inhibition might determine its ability to induce neuronal apoptosis.
