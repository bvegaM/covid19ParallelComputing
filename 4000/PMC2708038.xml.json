Nidoviruses have similar genome organization and replication strategies but they differ in morphology, genome size, and several other biological properties.1",

ORF1a encodes the polyprotein 1a (pp1a) and ORF1a and 1b together code for pp1ab. Synthesis of the latter depends on a (\u22121) ribosomal frameshift during translation, which occurs just upstream of the ORF1a stop codon. In most coronaviruses, the polyproteins are processed by two papain-like proteases (PL1pro and PL2pro) and the main proteinase (Mpro), all of which are encoded within ORF1a. The resulting 15 (IBV) or 16 nonstructural proteins (Nsps) are associated with genomic and/or subgenomic RNA synthesis (replication and transcription, respectively). Some of them may also be involved in interactions with host-cell components.",

The amide of Gly 48 makes a 3.0 \u00c5 hydrogen bond to the O1\u2033 of the distal ribose and Phe 133 packs against this sugar on its opposite face. The backbone amide groups of Ser 129, Gly 131, Ile 132, and Phe 133 donate hydrogen bonds to the phosphate oxygens. Most importantly, the side-chain of Ile 132 is in close contact (3.5 \u00c5) with Gly 48, thereby forming a \u201cbridge\u201d over the binding cleft.19 Even in the absence of ADP-ribose, this close interaction exists in SARS-X (4.1 \u00c5; Ref.18). The \u201ctriple glycine\u201d sequence is conserved in most coronavirus X-domains, with a few exceptions, including IBV (strain Beaudette, but not all IBV strains) and MHV, which have the second glycine replaced by Ser and Ala, respectively, and TGEV and FCoV, which have Met and Val, respectively, instead of the first glycine. The replacement of the \u201ccentral glycine\u201d by serine is correlated with dramatic structural differences between the X-domains of IBV (strain Beaudette) and SARS-CoV: as the close contact to the conserved isoleucine (no. 131 in IBV-X) is no longer possible, the bridge across the binding cleft collapses, and the entire \u03b26-\u03b15 (L11) loop carrying the 128SLGIFG133 segment is pushed away (see Fig. 4). As a consequence, the C\u03b1 atom of Ile 131 in the high-pH form of IBV-X is located 5.9 \u00c5 away from the position of the corresponding Ile 132 in SARS-X [Fig. 4(A)].

            "text": "Our data show that the IBV-X (strain Beaudette) fails to bind ADP-ribose. This observation is explained by the three-dimensional structure of the protein. The replacement by serine of the central glycine (Gly 47) of the triple-Gly sequence that forms part of the ADP-ribose binding site, pushes away the opposite Ile 131 and leads to a major conformational change of the loop (L11) carrying this residue (see Fig. 4), resulting in the loss of as many as five hydrogen bonds and one hydrophobic interaction with ADP-ribose. Therefore, we conclude that not all coronavirus X-domains bind ADP-ribose or poly(ADP-ribose) and suggest that either the X-domain in IBV (strain Beaudette) is a relict of evolution, or it has another function remaining to be characterized.",

The two proteins were produced and purified in similar ways. The respective plasmid was transformed into the competent E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain. Cultivation in 1\u00d7 TY medium was performed at 37\u00b0C. Gene expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mM IPTG when cells had reached an optical density of 0.5 at 660 nm. Expression was carried out at 20\u00b0C for 5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 7200g and 4\u00b0C. The cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, pH 8.0, for 229E-X and 50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 8.0, for IBV-X, each including 10 mg lysozyme and one Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Cells were broken by French press. After ultracentrifugation (150,000g, 1 h, 4\u00b0C) of the sample, the supernatant was applied to a His-Trap FF 5-mL column (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany) with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. After washing with the buffer mentioned earlier, the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 20\u2013500 mM imidazole. For IBV-X, the buffer was changed to cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), pH 8.0) by size exclusion on a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany). TEV protease and X-domain carrying an N-terminal His6 tag were combined to a molar ratio of 1 : 40 (protease: tagged IBV-X) and the sample was incubated for 16 h at 20\u00b0C. To separate tag-free IBV-X from the His6 tag and the TEV protease, the protein solution was applied to a His-Trap FF 5-mL column (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany) with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. In case of 229E-X, the His6-tag-free protein tended to precipitate after incubation with the TEV protease at 20\u00b0C and even at 4\u00b0C. Therefore, purification of this X-domain was carried out without removal of the His6 tag and the protein was applied to the Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany) for size exclusion and buffer exchange (10 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.5) directly after Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography. IBV-X was treated in the same way after the cleavage. For further details, see Piotrowski et al.46",

In case of IBV-X5.6, molecular replacement was not straightforward and required the usage of eight superimposed coordinate sets. This ensemble included structures of similar fold as predicted by FFAS03 (Ref.53; PDB codes: 1YD9, 1ZR3, 2DX6, 1SPV, 1ZR5, 2ACF) and previously solved structures of the X-domain from HCoV NL63 (Piotrowski et al., in preparation) and HCoV 229E (this communication). Truncation of flexible regions in the search model was crucial to obtain a clear molecular replacement solution. To improve the relatively poor overall electron density of the initial model, protein backbone conformations were remodeled, ambiguous side-chains were changed to alanine, and two helices were adjusted manually.

In contrast to the X-domain of IBV strain Beaudette, which is the subject of the present paper, residue 47 is a glycine rather than a serine in the protein of IBV strain M41. Thus, the canonical triple-glycine sequence seen in other coronavirus X-domains is conserved and ADP-ribose binding is not prevented, in contrast to the X-domain of IBV strain Beaudette.

Carbon atoms of the ADP-ribose are colored white, carbon atoms of the protein are colored yellow and green, for SARS-X and IBV-X, respectively.

B: Residues 42GGG44 and 122SCGIFG127 (L11) of 229E-X (sticks, blue carbon atoms), likely involved in binding ADP-ribose, superimposed onto the corresponding site (46GSG48 and 128SLGIFG133) in IBV-X8.5 (transparent surface colored according to electrostatic potential, green sticks). Residue labels for 229E-X are framed. Note that Ile 131, and with it, the entire loop L11, in IBV-X is \u201cpushed away\u201d (red arrows) due to steric hindrance from Ser 47, thereby destroying the binding site for ADP-ribose.",
