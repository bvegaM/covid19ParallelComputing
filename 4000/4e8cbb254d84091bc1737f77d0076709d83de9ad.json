            "text": "Background: Fever is a common cause of pediatric consultation in the emergency department. However, identifying the source of infection in many febrile infants is challenging because of insufficient presentation of signs and symptoms. Meningitis is a critical cause of fever in infants, and its diagnosis is confirmed invasively by lumbar puncture. This study aimed to evaluate potential laboratory markers for meningitis in febrile infants. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed infants aged <3 months who visited the emergency department of our hospital between May 2012 and May 2017 because of fever of unknown etiology. Clinical information and laboratory data were evaluated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed. Results: In total, 145 febrile infants aged <3 months who underwent lumbar punctures were evaluated retrospectively. The mean C-reactive protein (CRP) level was significantly higher in the meningitis group than in the non-meningitis group, whereas the mean white blood cell count or absolute neutrophil count (ANC) did not significantly differ between groups. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for CRP was 0.779 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.701-0.858). The AUC for the leukocyte count was 0.455 (95% CI, 0.360-0.550) and that for ANC was 0.453 (95% CI, 0.359-0.547). The CRP cut-off value of 10 mg/L was optimal for identifying possible meningitis. Conclusion: CRP has an intrinsic predictive value for meningitis in febrile infants aged <3 months. Despite its invasiveness, a lumbar puncture may be recommended to diagnose meningitis in young, febrile infants with a CRP level >10 mg/L.",

            "text": "Meningitis is one of the causes of fever, and lumbar puncture (LP) is required to determine the presence of meningitis by obtaining a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample. Making a decision of when to perform an LP to differentiate meningitis from other diseases can be difficult [7] . In early-onset sepsis in the neonatal period, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends performing an LP in the case of positive blood culture results, if the \"clinical course or laboratory data strongly suspect bacterial sepsis, \" or if the infant does not respond to antimicrobial therapy [8] . However, even with meningitis, young infant patients often do not present symptoms such as fever, vomiting, or headache, and blood culture examinations normally take a couple of days. Therefore, many clinicians rely on laboratory findings, including the level of C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute-phase reactant synthesized by the liver in response to tissue injury or inflammation, which is a sensitive marker for infection [9, 10] . The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published clinical guideline 149 (CG149) that suggests considering LP if the blood culture result is positive, the patient does not respond to antimicrobial therapy, or if the patient has a CRP level > 10 mg/L [11] . Many studies have analyzed the diagnostic markers for serious bacterial infections in febrile infants, but markers indicating meningitis and the cut-off values for the diagnosis of meningitis have rarely been evaluated.",

Bacterial meningitis was confirmed based on the culture results of the CSF, Wellcogen (Remel Europe Ltd., Dartford, Kent, UK) bacterial antigen rapid latex agglutination test, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using dual priming oligonucleotide, Seeplex (MT Promedt Consulting GmbH, St. Ingbert, Germany). Viral meningitis was confirmed based on positive viral multiplex PCR results in the CSF. Aseptic meningitis was confirmed by negative bacterial growth in the CSF. For comparative analysis, we distinguished aseptic meningitis from viral meningitis. We confirmed that no bacterial pathogens were found in all investigated specimens from the aseptic or the viral meningitis groups. Undetermined fever was defined when the cause of fever was not revealed after 7 days of hospitalization. Urinary tract infection was diagnosed with pyuria (WBC > 5/high power field) and the isolation of > 100,000 colony-forming units per milliliter of a single pathogen from the urine collected in a urine bag. Cultures with more than one isolate were considered contaminated. Fever was defined as a tympanic membrane temperature of 38\u00b0C or higher.",

When febrile infants without a clear source of infection seek treatment in a hospital, deciding the management approach is quite challenging for clinicians. Particularly, febrile infants aged < 3 months are frequently evaluated for the risk of invasive bacterial infections such as bacteremia or bacterial meningitis in the pediatric department [13, 14] . The probability of serious bacterial infection without a definitive etiology is reported to be approximately 12% in the neonatal period and up to 9% between 1 and 3 months of age [15] . Diagnostic tests for differentiating severe bacterial infections from viral infections have long been the focus of several investigations [16] . Chest radiography has been used for diagnosing pneumonia. Urine and CSF samples have been used for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection and meningitis, respectively [17] . However, deciding the timing of LP for CSF sampling has been challenging [7] . For neonates with early-onset sepsis, the AAP recommends performing LP if the blood culture result is positive with clinical or laboratory findings strongly indicating bacterial sepsis or if the patients do not respond to antibiotic therapy [8] . Gajdos et al. [18] analyzed predictive factors of bacterial infection in febrile infants aged < 3 months and found that only an elevation in WBC with > 50% of neutrophils and an elevation in CRP levels > 20 mg/L could predict serious bacterial infection, with a negative predictive value of 93%. Pulliam et al. [1] demonstrated that CRP level was a better diagnostic tool than WBC and ANC for predicting serious bacterial infection in a group of febrile children aged between 1 and 36 months. During infection or inflammation, the plasma pro-calcitonin (PCT) concentration is known to both increase and return to normal concentration more rapidly than the CRP level [19] . The PCT level was also observed to increase faster than the CRP level 6 hours after the onset of severe infection or inflammation [20] . Therefore, the PCT test has been considered a useful tool for early diagnosis of infection [21] . In other studies, PCT was found to be a useful biomarker to distinguish between bacterial and viral meningitis [22] . Moreover, in Korea, several published studies have focused on the value of laboratory markers in discriminating serious bacterial infections, and Hur et al. [23] studied the diagnostic value of PCT and CRP simultaneously using blood samples from 1,270 patients with blood culture-positive sepsis. According to their report, the diagnostic utility of the PCT was better than that of CRP. However, in the case of diagnosing neonatal bacterial infection, the PCT test was found to be more expensive, with similar or better sensitivity than CRP and acceptable specificity [24] . Kim et al. [25] also reported that in febrile infants aged \u2264 6 months, there is no diagnostic value of measuring serum PCT concentration for determining bacterial infection. Since a PCT assay is more expensive than CRP level analysis and is not readily available in all facilities, only a few infants are analyzed for changes in the PCT level. In contrast, CRP can be determined in less than an hour using a small amount of blood and the CRP level test is not cost intensive. Hence, we determined a cut-off level for CRP for better diagnostic accuracy and ease of access to all patients. Sturgeon et al. [7] suggested that it does not appear prudent to assign CRP cut-off values for consideration in LP for neonates because of its low sensitivity and specificity. They emphasized the importance of a multi-faceted decision-making process based on clinical assessment, microbiology results, as well as any blood test findings such as CRP level [7] .",

As shown in Fig. 2 , various cut-off levels of CRP had better sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV than those of WBC or ANC. Our data also showed that different cut-off values of CRP levels had different diagnostic values (Table 3) . We found that with assuming a cut-off CRP level of 10 mg/L, the sensitivity and specificity for predicting meningitis were both > 70%, with a relatively high NPV > 80%.",

First, this study was conducted using medical records from a single hospital; thus, our study population does not represent the whole population of infants in Korea. Second, we collected urine samples using urine bags rather than catheterization or bladder puncture, which could have increased the likelihood of contamination. Finally, a comparison between the bacterial meningitis group and the aseptic meningitis group could not be performed because there were only 3 cases of bacterial meningitis in this study cohort. Even with these limitations, this comparative analysis of laboratory markers for predicting meningitis in infants is significant in terms of its contribution to the literature.",

We suggest the use of CRP levels as a part of the evaluation for every febrile infant aged < 3 months. CRP levels > 10 mg/L suggest the presence of meningitis in febrile infants with greater accuracy. However, clinicians should keep in mind that a single laboratory marker indicates only the probability but never the certainty of the presence or absence of meningitis.",
