            "text": "Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I, or HLA-I in humans) molecules are cell-surface glycoproteins. Their function is to select peptides derived from the intracellular protein metabolism and present them to cytotoxic T cells of the adaptive immune system, thereby allowing the protein content of cells to be surveyed and controlled (reviewed in Guermonprez et al., 2002 \u25b6). The specificity of MHC-I molecules determines which peptides will be presented and potentially recognized by the immune system. The HLA system is highly polymorphic in a manner that effectively diversifies immune responsiveness. Almost 1600 different HLA-I alleles have been identified in human populations, making MHC-I the most polymorphic gene system known. In an attempt to reduce this complexity, it has been suggested that the majority of HLA-I molecules can be clustered into one of 12 currently defined HLA supertypes. More than 120 different HLA-I crystal structures have been reported and the majority of these belong to the HLA-A2 supertype; other supertypes are sparsely populated or not at all. Only a few structures of HLA-I alleles belonging to the HLA-B62 supertype have been reported, including two structures of HLA-B*1501 (R\u00f8der et al., 2006 \u25b6). HLA-B*1501 is the prototypical member of the HLA-B62 supertype. HLA-B*1501 is frequent in Southeast Asian and in European populations, where it often accounts for more than 10% of the HLA-I phenotype.",

To this end, we are generating structural (Blicher et al., 2005 \u25b6, 2006 \u25b6; R\u00f8der et al., 2006 \u25b6) and biochemical (Buus et al., 1995 \u25b6; Sylvester-Hvid et al., 2002 \u25b6; Lauem\u00f8ller et al., 2000 \u25b6) information on peptide\u2013HLA interactions and using this information to generate fast computational predictions of peptide binding (Stryhn et al., 1996 \u25b6; Buus et al., 2003 \u25b6; Peters et al., 2006 \u25b6). A detailed understanding of peptide\u2013MHC interactions will support a general understanding of the nature of T-\u00adcell recognition and a rational exploitation of human immune responses (Lauem\u00f8ller et al., 2000 \u25b6). Thus, predictive algorithms allow entire genomes to be rapidly and accurately screened for potential immunogenic epitopes (Wang et al., 2007 \u25b6). One approach, which might be independent of large-scale biochemical experimentation, would be to use structural information to predict peptide binders (Rognan et al., 1999 \u25b6). To populate the \u2018structure space\u2019 of HLA molecules, we have previously reported two HLA-A*1101 (Blicher et al., 2005 \u25b6, 2006 \u25b6) and two HLA-B*1501 structures (R\u00f8der et al., 2006 \u25b6). Here, we report a crystal structure of HLA-B*1501 in complex with a SARS coronavirus-derived nonapeptide (VQQESSFVM).",

Structural superpositioning of this and a previously published HLA-B*1501 structure (PDB code 1xr9) using the first 181 CA atoms in the \u03b1-chain yields a root-mean-square deviation of 0.34 \u00c5. The structure consists of all of the residues of the heavy (a) and light (b) chains and the bound peptide (p) (see Table 1 \u25b6 for details). The model was refined to an R value of 18.8% and an R\nfree value of 22.7%. Generally, the electron density is clearly defined and all the residues lining the peptide-binding groove and the peptide residues are completely resolved (see Fig. 2 \u25b6). Furthermore, the disulfide bond in the \u03b12 domain of the peptide-binding groove is clearly defined, as depicted in the inset in Fig. 1 \u25b6. It has been speculated that the oxidation state of this disulfide bond is important for the loading of the peptide-binding groove with a peptide (Park et al., 2006 \u25b6). When this disulfide bond is oxidized and a peptide is bound, the \u03b11 and \u03b12 domains are thought to be more stable. Some solvent-exposed residues (including pSer5 of the peptide) are found in multiple conformations. A Ramachandran analysis estimated that 91.4% of the residues are found in the favoured regions and no residues are found in disallowed regions.",

As previously described for HLA-B*1501, this pocket is lined by hydrophobic residues and can accommodate large aromatic residues such as Tyr and Phe (R\u00f8der et al., 2006 \u25b6). The present HLA-B*1501\u2013peptide structure contains a C-\u00adterminal methionine residue, pMet9, which is found in an extended conformation reaching the apex of the F pocket. The F pocket is lined by aLeu81, aLeu95, aTyr123 and aTrp147, rendering this environment mostly hydrophobic. aSer116 is located at the bottom of the F pocket and points towards the \u03b11 domain of the peptide-binding groove. Hence, aSer116 points away from the docked pMet9 side chain and is unable to interact with this C-terminal peptide residue. pMet9 along with a114 have been shown to not only have a direct influence on the F-pocket specificity but also to influence the interaction of HLA-I with tapasin (Park et al., 2003 \u25b6; Thammavongsa et al., 2006 \u25b6). The peptide C-terminal O atoms make one hydrogen bond to the N\u03b42 atom of aAsn80 and one to the N\u03b6 atom of aLys146, which stabilizes peptide binding and at the same time shields the peptide C-terminus from interactions with a T-cell receptor.",
