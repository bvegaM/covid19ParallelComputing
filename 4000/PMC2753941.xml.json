The hepatotropic MHV3 serotype induces acute or chronic hepatitis according to the strain, age and immune status of the mouse. Moreover, MHV3 can replicate in hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) and Kupffer cells (KC), leading to virus-induced cell death, resulting in a fulminate hepatitis in susceptible C57BL/6 mice, and their death within 3\u20135 days postinfection (p.i.).11 We have previously reported that the development of hepatitis in pathogenic L2-MHV3-infected C57BL/6 mice is related to a decrease in splenic and myeloid NK cells because of the formation of syncytia and their subsequent apoptosis.12 Moreover, in vivo depletion of NK cells during MHV infections enhances virus replication, which in turn leads to a more pronounced hepatitis.13 In contrast, no or low decreases in NK cells were detected in mice infected with attenuated virus variants,12,14 suggesting a protective role of NK cells in hepatitis.",

AgB10 binds an area between the first and second immunoglobulin domains of the CEACAM1a.29,43 However, experiments using plates bound with anti-CEACAM1a AgB10 antibodies, or the SHP-1 inhibitor, revealed that engagement of CEACAM1a receptors activates the SHP-1 signalling pathway, which in turn leads to the inhibition of IFN-\u03b3 production by NK cells in the presence of L2-MHV3. The CEACAM1a receptor exists under two isoforms constituted either of a long inhibiting cytoplasmic domain, which contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), or a short activating cytoplasmic domain, which does not possess ITIMs or ITAMs.44 Ortaldo et al.45 have recently demonstrated that IL-12 and IL-18 override the inhibitory mechanisms of the Ly-49 inhibitory receptors containing ITIMs, so enabling IFN-\u03b3 production. These authors have nevertheless noticed that cross-linking of activating Ly49 receptors which possess ITAMs is essential for a response to IL-12 and IL-18. CEACAM1a receptor has already been associated with the inhibition of the IFN-\u03b3 production by human NKT cells.20 In our study, CEACAM1a may play an inhibitory role, by cross-linking or homotypic interactions, in IFN-\u03b3 production by NK cells. On the other hand, inhibition of SHP-1, which is associated with ITIMs,35 increased the production of this cytokine. CEACAM1a may therefore be involved in the modulation of an IL-12/IL-18-dependent IFN-\u03b3 pathway in NK cells. We can hypothesize that the high number of viral S proteins produced by MHV3-infected hepatic cells may bind to CEACAM1a molecules expressed at the NK cell surface attenuating the secretion of IFN-\u03b3.",

The p38 MAPK pathway therefore links the viral infection in the NK cells with activation mediated by rIL-12 and rIL-18. The production of IFN-\u03b3 by NK cells stimulated with IL-12 and/or IL-18 is dependent on the activation of ITAMs and is regulated through the p38 and ERK-1/2 MAPK pathways.9,10 Pretreatment of NK cells with IL-12 for 15 min is sufficient for IFN-\u03b3 induction.10 Simultaneously, the p38 MAPK pathway is essential for the first steps of MHV replication,28 whereas the ERK-1/2 MAPK pathway is predominantly activated by CEACAM1a.36 We have observed that UV-inactivated L2-MHV3 fails to induce IFN-\u03b3 production compared with the infectious L2-MHV3, indicating that a RNA-dependent phase of the viral replication, rather than viral fixation to CEACAM1a receptor, is involved in the synergistic IFN-\u03b3 production. The UV-inactivated virus may bind to the CEACAM1a receptor and be internalized, but cannot induce the translation of viral messenger RNA. Effectively, Banerjee et al.28 have demonstrated that UV-inactivated MHV failed to activate MAPKs, whereas activation of p38 MAPK and c-Jun terminal kinase are essential for phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor 4E involved in the enhancing of translation rates of cap-containing messenger RNA.",

This result reinforces the implication of the synergistic production of IFN-\u03b3 by NK cells occurring at an early stage in viral replication. Recently, Barr et al.46 have reported a rapid and transient activation of NK cells and IFN-\u03b3 production following infection with herpes simplex virus type 1, resulting from a release of IL-18 by dendritic cells. We cannot exclude the possibility that the loss of synergistic production of IFN-\u03b3 when NK cells were pretreated with rIL-12/rIL-18 for 2 hr before infection with L2-MHV3 may be consequent to impaired expression of CEACAM1a. Indeed, IFN-\u03b3 reduces the expression of CEACAM1a, as reported by Vassao et al.22 Consequently, NK cells may become resistant to a subsequent fixation of MHV3, which in turn would affect IFN-\u03b3 production.",

            "text": "During the acute phase of viral infection, recruitment of NK cells from the bone marrow or spleen to the affected organ is generally observed.8 Several studies have demonstrated that myeloid or splenic NK cells are essential during acute hepatitis, as these cells determined antiviral protection.3,12,14,17 For the induction of an efficient antiviral response by recruited NK cells, the intrahepatic microenvironment must be adequate to activate them. Hepatic NK cells normally colocalize at sites expressing viral antigen and IFN-\u03b3 during infection.47 This environment may allow NK cells to receive cell-to-cell or cell-to-matrix contact signals that favour an IL-12-dependent IFN-\u03b3 secretion, as NK cells are differently activated by IL-18 depending on their localization.48 However, recruited NK cells in liver require activation by adequate levels of IL-12 and IL-18 to become high producers of IFN-\u03b3. It is known that liver KC produced IL-12 and IL-18 following various stimuli and activated intrahepatic NK and NKT cells to produce IFN-\u03b3.49 The results that we have provided are in agreement with a previous in vivo study, reporting that treatment with rIL-12 and rIL-18 of susceptible mice creates an anti-MHV3 state by significantly increasing IFN-\u03b3 production.18 However, IL-12 and IL-18 were not induced in livers from L2-MHV3-infected C57BL/6 mice, preventing the synergistic IFN-\u03b3 production by recruited NK cells. In addition, the recruited intrahepatic NK cells from spleen and bone marrow may be infected by L2-MHV3 produced by infected LSEC or KC, leading to a virus-induced apoptosis phenomenon. The susceptibility of C57BL/6 mice to acute hepatitis reflects an inefficient innate antiviral response by low IFN-\u03b3 production because of deficient IL-12/IL-18 production and apoptosis of NK cells. The apoptosis of intrahepatic recruited NK cells, such as previously reported for spleen and bone marrow,12\u201314 is an additional evading mechanism of the innate antiviral defence. Our results suggest that intrahepatic NK cells from resistant mice, as A/J or C3H mice, would produce an efficient IFN-\u03b3 response in the presence of adequate intrahepatic IL-12 and IL-18 levels.",

In fact, viral infection of KC and LSEC may favour the viral infection of NK cells when these cells are in contact. These observations suggest that IL-12/IL-18 produced in vivo by KC may be essential to preserve the antiviral functions of NK cells, and the integrity of LSEC favours the survival of NK1.1 cells recruited to the liver.
