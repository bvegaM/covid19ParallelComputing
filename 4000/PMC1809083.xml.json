Evidence from human and mouse studies suggest that lymphocytes clear RSV during infection. Children with cell-mediated immunodeficiencies take longer to terminate infection with RSV [3]. In the mouse model, Graham et al. [4] have studied the effect of depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ lymphocytes during acute RSV infection. CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte subsets are involved in terminating primary infection and if both T lymphocyte subsets are depleted RSV shedding is prolonged. However, depletion of lymphocytes in mice also reduces clinical symptoms and lung injury. Research into the increased pathology in recipients of the formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine in the 1960s has implicated aberrant CD4 lymphocytes as the mediators [5]. These data suggest that lymphocytes may also play a role in causing lung pathology in RSV infection.",

The most striking change in circulating white cell count is a reduction in lymphocyte numbers and this effect is more pronounced in sicker children [8]. It has been suggested that this reduction in lymphocyte count be due to redistribution to the lung [9]. However, lymphopenia is also known to occur in other viral illnesses, including measles, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and ebola [10\u201312]. There are data to suggest that apoptosis of lymphocytes occurs in both these illnesses and may offer a mechanism for this lymphocyte decline.",

Two key apoptotic cascades have so far been identified as important in the removal of mature, circulating lymphocytes; death receptor mediated and mitochondrial-dependent [13]. Cell surface death receptors, including Fas (CD95) and tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor, are activated by the binding of specific ligands: Fas ligand and TRAIL. Both pathways lead to the activation of a cascade of specific proteolytic enzymes, caspases, causing the cell to die. Fas ligand may be membrane bound or soluble (sFas) ligand and the soluble form may mediate Fas-dependent apoptosis of bystander cells [14].",

Infants were included in the study if admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis at 9 months of age or younger; they were RSV positive by routine nasopharyngeal aspirate immunofluorescence and if parents gave written informed consent. For the purposes of this study, the clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis also included a requirement for supplemental oxygen to maintain arterial saturations greater than 92%. All blood samples were taken within 48 h of admission. It is known that parental recollection of day that their child's symptoms began is unreliable and so we chose not state which day of the illness blood was sampled on. However, the day of admission to hospital is usually close to the peak of clinical symptoms and we attempted to obtain blood samples as close to this time as possible. Children with a suspected or known immunodeficiency were excluded from the study. Parents were asked to return with their child for convalescent blood sampling 3 months following the acute illness. All samples were taken immediately to the laboratory for analysis for processing after being taken.",

We have also demonstrated up-regulated expression of cell surface receptors (Fas and TRAIL receptor) on CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes and increased plasma levels of sFas ligand in the acute illness. Increased Fas expression correlated with lymphopenia. Direct evidence of intravascular apoptosis was not sought since the small quantity of blood that can be obtained from a critically ill baby precluded the use of direct assays such as DNA laddering. Taken together these findings suggest that death receptor-mediated apoptosis is involved in the reduction of lymphocyte numbers in this disease. Our data show that there is an inverse correlation with age suggesting there may be a critical period of infancy during which these effects are most pronounced.",

            "text": "In summary, our data support the hypothesis that the lymphopenia seen in RSV bronchiolitis is associated with apoptosis. The effect is most pronounced in younger infants suggesting there is an important time in infancy when the immune system may be vulnerable. The reduction in lymphocytes is related to the degree of cellular expression of the receptors for apoptosis. Our findings mirror those in severe sepsis where data indicates that inhibition of apoptosis may ameliorate illness. Future dissection of this novel mechanism may help to delineate the delayed effects of RSV infection and offer new therapeutic avenues.",
