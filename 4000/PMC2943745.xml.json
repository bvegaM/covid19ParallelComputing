Two days before admittance to cloister (day -2), blood was drawn from each subject for repeat assay of serum RV39 neutralizing antibody titer. Subjects were then admitted to the cloister site, where they were confined to an isolated floor of a hotel for 6 days (day 0, 24-h preexposure period; days 1\u20135, sequential 24-h postexposure periods). On day 0, female subjects with positive urine pregnancy test results were excluded, as were subjects presenting with a CLI. At the end of day 0, each subject was inoculated with RV39 by direct instillation of course drops to the nasal mucosa at an estimated dose of \u223c100 times the median tissue culture infective dose [21]. On each day of cloister, all subjects underwent a general physical examination as well as an examination of the ears, nose, and throat and completed a symptom diary; in addition, nasal mucociliary clearance function was assessed, nasal secretion production was measured, and a nasal wash was performed, with samples aliquoted and frozen at \u221270\u00b0C for later assay. Throughout the study period, subjects were not permitted to take prescription or over-the-counter medications, with the exception of acetaminophen (which was dispensed by study personnel) and birth control drugs. At the end of day 5, the subjects were interviewed by a physician, provided with specific instructions for follow-up, and discharged from cloister. On or around study day 28, a convalescent blood sample was drawn from each subject. The study protocol and informed consent forms were approved by the institutional review boards at the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University.",

These polymorphisms were shown to affect other host responses during RSV infection [20] and the rate of vURTI complications [19, 23, 37]. For the outcomes examined in this study, only the IFN-\u03b3 +874 polymorphism was shown to have a significant effect, with its phenotype being an inverse predictor of the rate of seroconversion during RV39 infection. In adults experimentally infected with RSV, the TNF-\u03b1 \u2212308 phenotype was directly related to the frequency of seroconversion, whereas the IFN-\u03b3 +874 phenotype was indirectly related to the frequency of subjects developing a 2-fold increase in nasal RSV-specific secretory immunoglobulin A antibody titers [20].

Although the mechanism(s) by which that polymorphism exerts these effects remains elusive, given the complex and poorly understood temporal interactions among the various cytokines and other inflammatory chemicals in provoking the vSSC and other expressions of a vURTI [4], the simplest hypothesis can be rejected. Specifically, as reported here and in past studies [12, 14, 16], higher nasal IL-6 concentrations are positively correlated in both phase and magnitude with the expressed vSSC, leading to the expectation that the high-production IL-6 \u2212174 phenotype would predict higher nasal IL-6 concentrations and consequently greater illness magnitudes. However, neither of these expectations was supported by the experimental data; that is, no statistically significant relationship was demonstrated between the IL-6 \u2212174 phenotype and local IL-6 nasal secretion concentration for either experimental RV39 or experimental RSV infection in adults [20], and for all studies reviewed the low-production (not the high-production) IL-6 \u2212174 phenotype predicted greater illness and complications [19, 20, 23, 37].",

Moreover, there are a large number of polymorphisms in the genes for IL-6 and other cytokines that were not assayed in the present study but that have the potential to interact with the assayed polymorphisms to influence cytokine production [33, 41\u201344], and past studies have shown that the local production of specific cytokines was influenced by polymorphisms in the genes for other cytokines (eg, the TNF-\u03b1 -308 polymorphism predicted IL-6 and IL-8 protein concentrations in nasal secretions) [20].

Limitations of this study include the relatively few cytokine polymorphisms assayed, the assay of only IL-6 protein in nasal secretions, and the restriction of outcomes to seroconversion, provoked symptoms, and 2 objective measures of illness. In addition, because this study was limited to adults, in whom the frequency of vURTI complications is low, the effects of these cytokine polymorphisms on complication frequency could not be assessed. Nonetheless, it is highly likely that continued study of cytokine polymorphisms in the settings of natural and experimental vURTIs will yield important information regarding the genetic basis for CLIs, vURTIs, and vURTI complications.",
