The phage genome consists of \u223c44 kb (Alonso et al., 1997) with partially circularly permuted ends (Morelli et al., 1979; Tavares et al., 1992). Like other members of the Siphoviridae family, SPP1 has a long and flexible tail apparatus attached to an icosahedral capsid, \u223c650 \u00c5 in diameter. The tail apparatus serves as a conduit for the ejection of viral DNA from the viral capsid into the cell host and is attached immediately below the phage connector by the head\u2013tail joining protein gp17. In SPP1, the connector is defined as the trimeric complex formed by the portal protein gp6 and the head completion proteins, gp15 and gp16 (Orlova et al., 2003).",

            "text": "The structural organization of the SPP1 non\u2010contractile tail is known from electron microscopic studies (Plisson et al., 2007). The tail is built by a proteinaceous tail tube, which is flexibly joined to an adsorption tip, at the end distal from the connector. The tip, 310\u2010\u00c5\u2010long and 95\u2010\u00c5\u2010wide, contains the receptor binding domain and a beta\u2010strand\u2010rich protein, gp21, which is structurally similar to the phage P22 tailspike (Steinbacher et al., 1994) and is likely important for degradation of the host cell wall during infection. The tip is connected to the tail tube by gp19.1, which allows bending of the tip with respect to the tube, enhancing the ability of the tip to scan for receptors on the host surface. The most noticeable component of the phage tail, the tail tube, has a diameter of \u223c112 \u00c5 and is \u223c1600\u2010\u00c5\u2010long. It is composed of \u223c40 rings stacked vertically and rotated \u223c21\u00b0 relative to each other. The tube is built by two major tail proteins (MTP), gp17.1 and gp17.1*, in an approximate ratio 3:1. The diameter of the tail tube prior to DNA ejection is \u223c110 \u00c5, and it has an internal lumen \u223c56 \u00c5 in diameter, occupied by multiple copies of the tape measure protein, gp18.",

            "text": "Frameshifting is a well\u2010described process in which the ribosome begins reading out of frame at a designed point in an mRNA message. A random translational frameshift is an exceedingly rare event, as, normally, this would quickly lead to missense and nonsense mutations in the polypeptide chain. However, a variety of signals and mRNA secondary structures can enhance this rare process and increase the frequency of frameshifting to more than 80%, leading to what is usually referred to as a \u2018programmed\u2019 frameshift. Frameshifts can be programmed for one of two purposes: either to produce a specific ratio of two products or to add a level of regulation, where the frequency of frameshifting is variable and controlled in trans. Viral frameshifted proteins tend to be of the set ratio variety and function to produce structural proteins, while most non\u2010viral examples favour a regulatory role.",

            "text": "When altering the correct reading frame of an mRNA, two frameshifts are more likely: \u22121 frameshift, where the ribosome slips one nucleotide backwards and +1 frameshift (more rare), where the ribosome jumps one nucleotide (Fig. 1). The most widespread translational frameshift is the \u22121 frameshift, which occurs in many viruses (and phages) as well\u2010as in viral elements, such as transposons. This frameshift, in which the ribosome slips back one nucleotide out of its initial frame, is caused by a dual\u2010slippage event at a heptanucleotide site of the form X.XXY.YYZ, where the triplets indicate the Frame 0 reading frame. In this case, the ribosome can slip back by one base, and both the A\u2010site and P\u2010site still maintain two non\u2010wobble position base\u2010pairings. In this scenario, the P\u2010site slips from XXY to XXX and the A\u2010site from YYZ to YYY (Jacks et al., 1988; Ivanov and Atkins, 2007). This phenomenon is greatly enhanced when the second codon in the heptanucleotide (the YYZ) generated by the \u22121 frameshift is a rare codon, which causes the ribosome to stall while it waits for the new aminoacyl\u2010tRNA to occupy the A\u2010Site (Stahl et al., 2002).",

Viruses and phages use a variety of mechanisms such as Shine\u2010Dalgarno\u2010like sequences, stop codons or 3\u2032 pseudoknots and stem\u2010loops to stall the ribosome, which is the main factor influencing the efficiency of frameshifts (for an example, see Levin et al., 1993). In bacteriophage \u03bb, a \u22121 frameshift at the interface between gene T and gene G is used to produce the gene product G\u2010T at a frequency of \u223c4%. The \u03bb frameshift is located between the bases encoding residues 13\u201314, at a sequence G.GGA.AAG, where the Gly\u2010Lys product is produced in both the Frame 0 as well\u2010as the Frame \u22121. The mechanism seems to be induced by a pause in the ribosome caused by a rare cysteine codon immediately 3\u2032 to the lysine codon. This might lead to the ribosome pausing with the tRNAGly in the P\u2010site, the tRNALys in the A\u2010site, and then slipping back by one nucleotide, changing only the wobble base of the two tRNAs (Levin et al., 1993).",

In the bacteriophage PSA, a +1 frameshift occurs in the cps gene at the sequence ACA.CCC.UCC.G, which is followed by a pseudoknot at the 3\u2032 of the shift site (Zimmer et al., 2003). This frameshift results in a frequency of frameshifting (and generation of the longer product) of 13.2%, which is exactly the ratio of proteins needed to form pentons and hexons of a T = 7 phage (55 penton proteins and 360 hexon proteins) (Zimmer et al., 2003). This demonstrates the incredible level of fine\u2010tuning possible in these kinds of systems. In addition to the frameshift in the cps gene, there is another +1 frameshift in the tsh protein, which utilizes the shifty\u2010stop mechanism, induced by the sequence ACA.CCC.UGA, where the rare CCC proline codon pauses the ribosome, leading to a 25% frequency of frameshifting (a 1:3 ratio of long : short protein product) (Zimmer et al., 2003).",

This may be due to the CCC proline, which is five times less abundant than the CCU codon, which also encodes proline. Additionally, there are two stem\u2010loops present immediately following the stop (and shift site) of the Q54 orf23, one of which overlaps the ribosomal binding site of the shifted frame (orf24), resulting in lack of translation initiation for the orf24 gene (Fortier et al., 2006).",

            "text": "In this issue of Molecular Microbiology, Auzat et al. provide compelling evidence that the two major structural proteins of the SPP1 tail, gp17.1 and gp17.1* have a common N\u2010terminal sequence and that gp17.1* is further extended by a programmed translational frameshift. This frameshift extends gp17.1 (\u223c19.1 kDa) by \u223c10 kDa, to yield gp17.1* (\u223c28 kDa). The authors demonstrate that the frameshift takes place at the second of two rare proline codons (CCC). Slippage of the ribosome by +1 nucleotide leads to the in frame translation of \u223c80 codons of the open reading frame orf17.2, which extends downstream of the gene 17.1 stop codon by 87 amino acids. To demonstrate the critical role of the second proline codon in the translational frameshift, Auzat et al. introduced mutations at positions 1 and 2 of the first rare proline codon, with the goal of replacing the rare CCC codon with a more abundant codon. Such substitutions yielded single amino\u2010acid changes in gp17.1*, suggesting that the first CCC codon is neither necessary nor sufficient for the translational frameshift. In contrast, a single\u2010point mutation in the third base of the second codon (CCC\u2192CCT) completely abolished production of gp17.1*, confirming that the frameshift is caused by the second rare CCC codon and the presence of the adjacent in frame open reading frames orf17.2. By expressing the SPP1 gene 17.1 and orf 17.2 in a plasmid (pPT25), the authors elegantly reproduced the translational frameshift that yields gp17.1 and gp17.1* in Escherichia coli. As E. coli and B. subtilis share similar codon usage, the codon CCC is rare in both bacteria and causes the ribosome to slow down if repeated in tandem. Remarkably, overexpression of the rare tRNA for proline suppresses production of gp17.1*, suggesting that the stalling of the ribosome at the \u2018hungry\u2019 CCC codon is essential for the ribosome to slide +1 nucleotide on the messenger RNA. The ability to reproduce the translational frameshift in trans using a plasmid, allowed the authors to engineer SPP1 phages that selectively assemble only gp17.1 or gp17.1*. These phages are \u223c6.8 MDa heavier and \u223c4.6 MDa lighter respectively, than wild\u2010type SPP1 bacteriophage and present striking morphological differences. Tails assembled exclusively by gp17.1* are \u2018hairy\u2019 as compared with both wild\u2010type and gp17.1\u2010only tails. The protrusions irradiating from the tail tube that causes the rough surface appearance seen by electron microscopy represent the C\u2010terminal domain of gp17.1* translated as a result of the frameshift at codon 177. It has been suggested that the extra domain inserted into gp17.1* adopts an immunoglobulin\u2010like fold and may have a role in carbohydrate binding (Fraser et al., 2006; 2007).",

            "text": "The data presented by Auzat et al. (2008) reveal an elegant mechanism to generate structural complexity and likely functional versatility within the tail apparatus of the bacteriophage SPP1, while maintaining an efficient and minimal genome. The +1 programmed translational frameshift ensures production of two proteins in a relative stoichiometry of 3:1. In the absence of a translational frameshift, the virus would have to carry a second gene for gp17.1* with a weaker promoter to enable lower\u2010level production with respect to the gp17.1 gene product. However, a separate gene for gp17.1* would dramatically reduce the efficiently of tail self\u2010assembly and likely lead to a decreased number of infectious virions. In fact, assuming that in the wild\u2010type SPP1 phage, gp17.1 and gp17.1* co\u2010assemble translationally, the existence of separate gene products for gp17.1 and gp17.1* would favour the homotypic interaction gp17.1 : gp17.1 and gp17.1* : gp17.1* instead of the heterotypic assembly of gp17.1 : gp17.1*. In the absence of dedicated chaperons, the former scenario would likely make the SPP1 tail assembly and phage maturation dramatically less efficient. Likewise, a separate gene for gp17.1* would result in an enlargement of the viral genome to encode redundant information. Interestingly, the insertion domain of gp17.1* confers a \u2018hairy\u2019 appearance to the phage tail, as assessed by negative stain electron microscopy. It will be interesting to determine if phages lacking the gp17.1* protein undergo conformational changes in the tail tube similar to those seen for wild\u2010type SPP1 upon binding to the surface receptor YueB (Plisson et al., 2007). In conclusion, the data presented by Auzat et al. (2008) add a new step in the direction of understanding the assembly and architecture of the SPP1 non\u2010contractile tail apparatus. This remarkably dynamic machine is capable of propagating the signal for ejection from the cell surface receptor to the connector across \u223c1600 \u00c5 of tail tube. This unprecedented long\u2010distance signal transduction commits the virus to a new cycle of infection and leads to ejection of the viral genome into the host.",

In the standard model of a \u22121 frameshift, the ribosome encounters the sequence X.XXY.YYZ and is paused usually as a result of a 3\u2032 secondary structure in the mRNA (e.g. a stem\u2010loop or pseudoknot). During this pause, the ribosome slips backwards one base, with both the A\u2010site and P\u2010site re\u2010annealing, changing only the base pairing of the wobble base. B. In the +1 frameshift, the ribosome pauses immediately before a stop codon, normally waiting for a rare tRNAPro (shown as dashed) at the proline \u2018CCC\u2019 codon. This leads the ribosome to move forward one base, and in the case of the rare tRNAPro, the A\u2010site finds the more common \u2018CCU\u2019 codon rather than the rare \u2018CCC\u2019.",
