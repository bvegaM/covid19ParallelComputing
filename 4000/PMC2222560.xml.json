Comparative genomics has made it possible to identify similarity between Nsp15 and only one other protein, XendoU, an endoribonuclease from Xenopus laevis studied by Caffarelli et al. (1997 \u25b6). XendoU is involved in the processing of U16 small nucleolar RNA from its host pre-mRNA. It is poly(U)-specific and requires Mn2+ as a cofactor (Caffarelli et al., 1997 \u25b6; Laneve et al., 2003 \u25b6). It has been suggested, therefore, that Nsp15 might be an endoribonuclease (Snijder et al., 2003 \u25b6), which is unique to nidoviruses within the RNA viral world.",

The main activity of Nsp15 is to cleave 5\u2032 to uridylates in double-stranded RNA, which requires the presence of divalent cations. Like other endoribonucleases, Nsp15 uses Mn2+ as cofactor; in the presence of Mg2+ or other metal cations lower or no activity is detected. Nsp15 has been shown to be highly specific for RNA. DNA is not cleaved and does not inhibit RNA digestion, thus indicating that it does not bind to Nsp15 (Bhardwaj et al., 2004 \u25b6). Single-stranded RNA is also cleaved, but less specifically and efficiently than double-stranded RNA (Ivanov et al., 2004 \u25b6). Electron microscopy as well as other biophysical techniques have revealed that Nsp15 monomers form hexameric structures (Guarino et al., 2005 \u25b6).",

In the second group, the reaction is performed using a histidine as a general base and a histidine or a glutamic acid as a general acid (Irie et al., 1997 \u25b6; Nishikawa et al., 1987 \u25b6; Steyaert et al., 1990 \u25b6; Thompson et al., 1994 \u25b6). The reaction generates a product carrying a cyclic 2\u2032-3\u2032 phosphodiester terminus. Recent work (Gioia et al., 2005 \u25b6) has suggested that XendoU and the viral endoribonucleases related to it do not belong to either of the previously described groups. Instead, this work reveals the existence of a new class of RNA-processing enzymes that require a metal ion for activity (mainly Mn2+), produce cyclic 2\u2032-3\u2032 phosphodiester termini and have two histidine residues that are essential for RNase activity.",

Dobbe and E. J. Snijder (Drosten et al., 2003 \u25b6) using two primers containing the attB sites of the Gateway recombination system (Invitrogen). A sequence encoding a hexahistidine tag was added at the 5\u2032 end of the gene. The cDNA was cloned in the pDest14 plasmid according to Gateway cloning technology (Invitrogen). Multiparameter expression screening in Escherichia coli was performed using a sparse matrix (Abergel et al., 2003 \u25b6), followed by the dot blot detection procedure (Vincentelli et al., 2005 \u25b6). The optimized expression condition used E. coli strain C41(DE3) (Avidis) transformed with the pLysS plasmid (Novagen) and grown in Turbo Broth media (Athena Enzymes) at 298 K. Overnight induction was performed with 0.5 mM IPTG when OD600 reached 0.5. Expression yielded about 1.5 mg of soluble Nsp15 per litre of culture. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A (50 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 1 mM PMSF, 0.2 mg ml\u22121 lysozyme, 0.1 \u00b5g ml\u22121 DNase, 20 mM MgSO4 and protease-cocktail inhibitor; Sigma) per OD600 unit and per litre of culture. Cells were lysed by sonication and centrifuged (20 000g) for 40 min at 277 K. The purification consisted of two steps. Firstly, IMAC (immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography) was performed on a Hisprep column (Amersham). The protein was eluted with 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole pH 8.0. Size-exclusion chromatography was performed using a Superdex 200 HiLoad 26/60 (Amersham) in 10 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl pH 7.5. Nsp15 was eluted with a retention volume corresponding to a molecular weight of about 250 kDa, corresponding to a hexameric association, as also observed by Guarino et al. (2005 \u25b6). Protein purity was analyzed by SDS\u2013PAGE. The recombinant protein was concentrated using Amicon Ultra (5000 kDa molecular-weight cutoff).",

However, crystallization failed under these conditions and the sodium chloride concentration had to be decreased, the final protein buffer being 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris pH 7.5.",

Calculation of the Matthews coefficient indicated that the asymmetric unit may contain either one or two molecules of Nsp15, which would correspond to a calculated solvent content of 75 or 51%, respectively (Matthews, 1968 \u25b6). No peak was identified when searching for a twofold axis in the self-rotation map calculated using the program GLRF (Tong & Rossmann, 1997 \u25b6), thus suggesting that the asymmetric unit contains one molecule. No structure with sufficient sequence similarity to Nsp15 is currently available; structure determination using selenomethionine-substituted protein for MAD/SAD phasing is thus necessary and has been initiated.",
