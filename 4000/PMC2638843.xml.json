Studies of host immune responses against these microbes and of the pathogenic mechanisms of these organisms should provide important insights for treatment and vaccine development. Identification of dominant T cell epitopes within the infectious organism using blood samples from infected or convalescent subjects is one of the steps that are essential for understanding and monitoring host immune responses. However, these samples can be difficult or impractical to obtain, in part because of geographic location and relative disease rarity. In this study, we describe an approach for mapping CD4+ T cell epitopes within the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) by using PBMC from healthy subjects. In principle, these techniques can be applied to any antigen from any microbe of interest.",

            "text": "SARS is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus (4\u20137). In 2003, the brief outbreak of the disease resulted in >8000 cases with \u223c10% mortality (8). SARS-CoV, the pathogen responsible for SARS, is a positive-sense, single-strand, \u223c29 700-nt RNA virus (9). SARS-CoV is related to but genomically and serologically distinct from other common coronaviruses (5, 10), including strains 229E and OC43 that cause 15\u201330% of common colds in humans (11, 12). Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV encodes four major structural proteins, the spike (S), envelope, matrix glycoproteins and the nucleocapsid protein (8, 13\u201315). Among these, the S protein plays a central role in mediating viral infection via receptor binding and membrane fusion with susceptible cells (16, 17). Natural human infection with SARS-CoV induces a long-lived neutralizing antibody response against the S protein (18, 19). There is also a good correlation between neutralizing antibody titer and protection from wild-type virus challenge in murine studies (20). In addition, it has been demonstrated that S protein is a dominant antigen for CD8+ T cell responses (21\u201325). To date, few studies have focused on CD4+ T cells in SARS-CoV infection (26, 27). As a result, very little is known about the SARS-CoV epitopes recognized by CD4+ T cells. In applying the tetramer-guided epitope mapping (TGEM) approach, we identified several naturally processed epitopes derived from SARS-CoV S protein by using PBMC from healthy subjects. These S protein-specific CD4+ T cells are present and responsive to antigen stimulation in most healthy subjects. As expected, these antigen-specific T cells were phenotypically naive, but they secreted significant amounts of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-13 following antigen stimulation. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using PBMC from healthy subjects to identify T cell epitopes of a microbe recognized by the naive repertoire. Applying this approach to other viral and bacterial antigens should provide valuable tools to study immunopathogenesis, develop diagnostics and evaluate vaccines for other newly emerging infectious organisms.",

CD4+ T cells from healthy unexposed subjects were used as responder cells. Responder cells were stimulated with 34 peptide pools of S protein and detected with HLA-matched tetramers loaded with corresponding peptide pools as described in Materials and methods. Representative tetramer staining results from a DR0401 subject #654 are shown in Fig. 1A. Positive staining was obtained for peptide pools #5, #7, #8, #9, #10, #19, #21, #23, #25, #26, #28 and #30 for DR0401 (Fig. 1A). The positive tetramer staining results for the single-peptide-loaded tetramers corresponding to positive pools are summarized in Fig. 1B. Peptides p22 and p23 (from pool #5), p32 (from pool #7), p39 (from pool #8), p41 (from pool #9), p48 (from pool #10), p92 (from pool#19), p105 (from pool #21), p111 (from pool #23), p121 (from pool #25), p126 and p129 (from pool#26) and p136 (from pool #28) were all shown to be antigenic. The antigenic peptide within pool #30 could not be identified using individual peptide-loaded tetramers. Therefore, DR0401/#30 tetramer-positive T cells were sorted out, cloned as T cell line and stimulated with individual peptides from pool #30 (S protein p146, p147, p148, p149 and p150) in a proliferation assay. This approach led to the identification of p148 as the antigenic peptide. This result was further confirmed by stimulating CD4+ T cells with p148 peptide and staining with DR0401/#30-pooled tetramer (Fig. 1B). An additional three peptides, p14 from pool #3, p61 and p62 from pool #13, were identified from subject #648 (Fig. 1C). Similar TGEM experiments were repeated for three additional subjects, and most antigenic peptides were confirmed in multiple subjects. The antigenic peptides identified from all four subjects are summarized in Table 1. The sequences of these DR0401-restricted antigenic peptides are summarized in Table 2.",

However, blood samples from infected human subjects are not readily available for research. In response to this problem, we hypothesized that relevant T cell responses could be induced and studied using blood samples from non-exposed individuals. We developed a protocol in which PBMC from healthy subjects were used to identify antigenic peptides within the spike protein of SARS-CoV. In these experiments, cells were stimulated with overlapping peptides that span the entire spike protein and positive T cell responses were screened by the TGEM approach (29\u201331). Subsequent validation of these peptides by stimulating PBMC from multiple subjects with intact spike protein and by immunizing HLA transgenic mice indicated that several of these peptides contain epitopes that were naturally processed and presented.

To some degree, it was surprising that antigen-specific T cells could be expanded and detected with relative ease from the naive population in the absence of dendritic cells. However, our previous study of CD4+ T cells directed against anthrax-protective antigen (32) implied that this approach would be feasible.

            "text": "Noting that responses to certain epitopes were observed in the majority of subjects (Tables 1 and 3), these epitopes were selected for homology studies to examine whether these responses were actually directed against the S protein from other coronavirus strains that had previously infected study subjects. A paired sequence homology analysis was performed for the selected peptides against S protein sequences from several other coronaviruses, including human coronavirus 229E, human coronavirus NL63, human coronavirus OC43 and human coronavirus HKU1. The observed homology was insufficient to suggest CD4+ T cell cross-reactivity with these other S proteins (Supplementary Figure 3, available at International Immunology Online). Rather, the homology analysis implied that the identified epitopes are unique for SARS S protein. This conclusion is also supported by the observation that CD4+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV peptides (p22, p23, p41, p62 and p148) were readily detected in sorted CD45RA+ (naive) but not sorted CD45RA\u2212 (memory) T cells (Supplementary Figure 4, available at International Immunology Online). So it would appear that the observed SARS-CoV-specific CD4+ T cells were naive rather than cross-reactive memory cells specific for other coronaviruses. These results differ from a previous study in which H5N1-reactive T cells were detected in healthy Caucasian subjects (32). In that study, the majority of H5N1-reactive T cells was of memory phenotype and showed cross-reactivity to previous circulating influenza viruses. This difference indicates that the T cell repertoire of the study population was immunologically naive to the SARS-CoV. The success of T cell epitope discovery using naive T cells underscores the sensitivity and specificity of MHC class II tetramer reagents in detecting antigen-specific T cells.",

The responsive cells originated from the CD45RA+ population and secreted robust levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-13 upon antigen stimulation. Homology studies indicated that the antigenic peptides shared only modest similarities with S proteins from other coronavirus strains, indicating that the observed responses were probably not cross-reactive. Many of the observed epitopes could be naturally processed and presented; they elicited responses in the majority of individuals tested. These findings suggested that tetramers can be used to identify T cell epitopes recognized by naive T cells and implied that potential dominant T cell epitopes within any newly emerging and re-emerging infectious organisms can be identified before a local outbreak.",
