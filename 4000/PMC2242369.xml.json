Culture inductions were conducted at 20\u00b0C overnight for optimal expression levels and solubility. Cell lysates from uninduced (UI) and induced (I) cultures, plus the soluble (S) and insoluble (IB) fractions from the induced cultures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Figs. 1\u20133).

A comparison of their respective proteases was then conducted to determine the catalytic efficiency of removing the fusion tag (Fig. 4; Table 2). The commonly used AcTEV protease was used to cleave the NUS A tag, and an AcTEV recognition sequence (ENLYFQ\u2018GXX) was engineered between the NUS A tag and the fusion partner. The kinetic parameters KM and kcat for AcTEV and SUMO protease were determined using the NUS A-eGFP and SUMO-eGFP substrates, respectively (Table 2). The generated data were fit to the Michaelis-Menton equation using nonlinear regression (R2 values were equal to 0.97 and 0.99 for the SUMO protease and AcTEV plots, respectively) (Fig. 4). The apparent KM of AcTEV for the NUS A-eGFP fusion (6.3 mM) is very similar to that of SUMO protease for the SUMO-eGFP fusion (3.3 mM), but its kcat (0.028 sec\u22121) is ~25-fold less than that of SUMO protease (0.782 sec\u22121), resulting in an enzyme with ~25 times lower catalytic efficiency. The KM and kcat values obtained for AcTEV are not similar to what has been previously reported (Nallamsetty et al. 2004). This is most likely due to the choice of substrates, as previous studies have been completed using peptide substrates with canonical recognition sites. The SUMO protease does not recognize a linear sequence like AcTEV, and as such, a full fusion construct had to be utilized for comparison purposes. It is expected that lower KM and higher kcat values would be obtained for the peptide substrate than for the full fusion construct.",

Many obstacles are encountered, however, when using E. coli as a host system. Gene fusion technology has been very successful at overcoming most of these obstacles and has increased the success of heterologous expression in E. coli. Ideally, a fusion tag should enhance expression and solubility of a wide variety of proteins. While several studies have compared the effectiveness of commonly used gene fusions in enhancing the expression and solubility of difficult-to-express proteins, none have included the newly described SUMO fusion system (Davis et al. 1999; Wang et al. 1999; De Marco et al. 2004).",

            "text": "Three candidate proteins were chosen for this study, eGFP, GDF8, andMMP13. eGFP was chosen due to its common use in biochemical laboratories and the ease at which it can be assayed. GDF8 is essential for proper regulation of human skeletal muscle mass (Lee and McPherron 2001). GDF8 was chosen, as recombinant expression in E. coli would greatly facilitate research efforts aimed at exploiting this potentially useful therapeutic target. Previous attempts to express GDF8 in E. coli have been hampered by poor yields, solubility, and lack of biological activity, and therefore, GDF8 is considered to be a difficult-to-express protein (Thomas et al. 2000; Taylor et al. 2001). Similarly, MMP13 is generally considered a potential therapeutic target and a difficultto- express protein (Pathak et al. 1998; Hardern et al. 2000). Although only a limited number of proteins were assayed for this study, patterns do emerge as to which tags are best for enhanced expression and solubility, especially for the difficult-to-express proteins used. In general, His6 tag afforded little to no enhanced expression. MBP was also observed to have little impact on expression, and did not enhance expression at all for the difficult-to-express proteins in this study (MMP13 and GDF8). Both the Ub and GST tags did provide mild enhancement of expression; however, the recombinant protein was mostly contained within the inclusion bodies. SUMO, TRX, and NUS A were the best tags at enhancing expression. The TRX tag did not enhance solubility for the difficult-toexpress proteins, while both SUMO and NUS A had pronounced soluble fusion protein expression.",

            "text": "For all polypeptides, there is a competition between aggregation and folding that rely on similar molecular interactions. Fusion partners have been shown to act as solubility enhancers, although the exact mechanism by which they improve solubility has not been described. It is speculated that fusion partners are able to keep the target protein in solution long enough for it to undergo its natural folding process, otherwise the target protein aggregates before it has sufficient opportunity to fold. A soluble fusion partner that slows the aggregation process inadvertently shifts the fusion protein to a folding pathway, increasing the amount of soluble protein. Fusion tags have also been hypothesized to enhance the solubility of the protein target by acting as a nucleus of folding (\u201cmolten globule hypothesis\u201d) (Creighton 1997; Englander 2000). This theory suggests that a fusion tag acts as a nucleation site for the folding of the target protein. Attachment of SUMO to the N terminus of a partner protein has been observed to promote correct folding and solubility. SUMO and Ub have highly homologous, rapidly folding structures (Khorasanizadeh et al. 1996). It may be that the tight, rapidly folding soluble structure of SUMO provides a nucleation site for the proper folding of C-terminally fused partner proteins. Indeed, expression of alternative configurations of the fusion (i.e., eGFP-SUMO) was not enhanced in E. coli (data not shown). The 55-kDa NUS A fusion tag also facilitates solubility of partner proteins. NUS A, a hydrophilic tag, was identified in a screen for E. coli proteins that have the highest potential for solubility when overexpressed (Davis et al. 1999). Protein expression levels are dependent on the stability of their mRNA, where degradation plays an important role controlling the levels of unstable transcripts (Arechaga et al. 2003). Both NUS A and SUMO were observed to enhance expression, but the role they play in stabilizing the mRNA transcript is unknown. Whereas NUS A levels of expression have been well documented, the novel SUMO tag has had modest published results. Table 3 represents a variety of fusion proteins that have been successfully expressed using the SUMO system. These SUMO fusion proteins have established a 5\u201325-fold increase in expression levels compared with their unfused counterparts (T.R. Butt, pers. comm.).",

While for the purpose of the present study MBP was fused solely to the N terminus of partner proteins, successful expression has also been achieved when MBP is fused to the C terminus of a protein (Sachdev and Chirgwin 2000). In fact, it has been found that N-terminal MBP fusions can reduce the efficiency of translation, which may explain the low yield in these experiments with MBP (Hamilton et al. 2002; Podmore and Reynolds 2002). These studies underscore the need for a comprehensive analysis of the fusion tags for the expression of various protein families. If the present study is confirmed, it would appear that commonly used fusions for enhanced soluble protein expression are not the best fusion tags available.",

In the present study, the best tags for enhanced expression and solubility (SUMO and NUS A) were further examined for the ease at which they are removed by their respective proteases (SUMO and AcTEV). Both AcTEV and SUMO proteases had similar affinities to their substrates. However, they differed dramatically in terms of catalytic efficiency (kcat), with SUMO protease being ~25 times more efficient than AcTEV. In addition to being more catalytically efficient, SUMO protease also has the advantage of recognizing the tertiary structure of SUMO and not a linear amino acid sequence like AcTEV. This characteristic prevents the SUMO protease from erroneously cleaving within the target protein, and thus, SUMO protease behaves as a universal protease, suitable for nearly every substrate. In addition, direct fusion of the target protein to SUMO allows for the generation of recombinant protein with native N-terminal sequences. Taken together, these data suggest that the SUMO fusion system may be ideal for the soluble expression of proteins that have been impossible using traditional gene fusions.",

In addition, all of the fusion tags except SUMO contained a cleavage site for AcTEV protease to facilitate the proper removal of the fusion tag upon purification. AcTEV was chosen in this study based on its high cleavage activity and it is commonly used in fusion technology. The cloning strategy used NcoI and BamHI sites upstream and downstream, respectively, of the fusion tag sequence, which was ligated pET24d vector. A BsaI restriction site was introduced by PCR directly downstream of the fusion tag sequence, upstream of the BamHI site in the reverse primer to ensure a consistent cloning strategy.",
