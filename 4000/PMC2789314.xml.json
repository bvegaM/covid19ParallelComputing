Collaborative efforts among human and animal healthcare professionals are required to monitor this situation and allow a timely and proportioned therapeutic response, limiting unnecessary use of valuable vaccines. The combination of rabies awareness campaigns, improved vaccine coverage and disease surveillance has already resulted in the successful elimination of canine rabies in North America [4]. However, vaccines need to be efficacious enough to elicit a response that will confer protection and diagnostic techniques are needed to ensure that adequate levels of virus-neutralising antibodies (VNAbs) have been achieved in response to vaccination. The problem with current tests is that they are not easily used in endemic areas within developing countries because they need to be set up in containment laboratories since highly pathogenic zoonotic viruses are required to perform the assay, or such assays are prohibitively expensive. Those that are e.g., ELISA-based assays, do not have the sensitivity or specificity of the fluorescent antibody virus neutralisation (FAVN) assay that is widely used within Office international des \u00e9pizooties (OIE) rabies reference laboratories. Therefore, in addition to the need for further implementation and development of improved anti-rabies biologicals, improved techniques to assess seroconversion are required before canine rabies is successfully eliminated in developing countries as it has been in North America.",

Clearly, infection by lyssaviruses of the other genotypes (2\u20137) can result in a clinical manifestation that is indistinguishable from rabies. The other genotypes are distributed geographically predominantly within African, European and Australian bat populations [5]. Recently, additional variants that are more divergent than genotypes 1\u20137 have been isolated suggesting further genotypes may yet exist [6\u201310]. Isolates representing genotypes 1, 2 and 4\u20137 have been identified in insectivorous, fruit or vampire bats [5]. Mokola virus (MOKV, genotype 3) along with Lagos bat virus (LBV, genotype 2) and Duvenhage virus (DUVV, genotype 4) comprises the African lyssaviruses. Interestingly, only a few clinical isolates representing these genotypes have been identified to date [11]. The handful of cases that have been reported has given us a limited understanding of the epidemiology and zoonotic threat that these genotypes pose in their respective hosts. Recently, surveillance programs and greater access to serosurveillance techniques have resulted in the discovery of a high seroprevalence against LBV in East and West African megachiroptera [12,13] and a common presence of LBV in South African bats collected for routine surveillance [11].",

However, there is also poor accessibility to vaccines and post-exposure treatments for those exposed to these viruses and there are difficulties with undertaking (sero)surveillance measures in many countries within Africa [15]. While the most important factor in reducing rabies prevalence is the implementation of vaccination campaigns, it was highlighted at the recent Southern and Eastern African Rabies Group meeting that poor infrastructure becomes a major barrier when attempting to control rabies in Africa [16]. These views are shared by the OIE and World Health Organization (WHO), that list the development of novel diagnostics as an urgent requirement [17,18].",

Variations of these assays have been described previously [22,23]. The routinely used FAVN assay and RFFIT are the current assays of choice with OIE/WHO reference laboratories but must be performed in BSL3/SAPO4 high containment facilities because live virus is handled as part of the assay. While a modified RFFIT that combines green fluorescent protein (GFP) with live recombinant virus can remove the need for expensive conjugates, work with recombinant virus still requires the use of high containment facilities [23]. With the recent addition to the above mentioned set of neutralisation assays of the ELISA-based method that uses plates coated with whole, inactivated virus, the need for live virus has been eliminated. Since both non-neutralising and neutralising antibodies are detected, the level of circulating, protective VNAbs alone cannot be determined. There are also issues with low sensitivity when using the ELISA.",

Here we report the results of the largest virus neutralisation study published to date using the surrogate lentiviral pseudotypes rather than the live native or recombinant rabies virus with field serum samples from Tanzanian dogs. We further increase the utility of our pseudotype neutralisation assay for laboratories undertaking vaccine trials and serosurveillance in resource-limited, rabies endemic countries by exploring the use of lacZ as a reporter gene and incorporating the glycoproteins of a further three lyssavirus genotypes, in addition to genotype 1, which will allow improved serosurveillance for lyssaviruses other than classical rabies. This report describes a highly sensitive yet flexible platform that can be adapted to allow the evaluation of vaccine and antiviral drugs against highly pathogenic viruses without the need for high level containment facilities or expensive reagents and equipment.",

Cells were infected with lacZ-based pseudotypes and subsequently stained with one of three \u03b2-gal substrates. Punctate blue staining of infected cell nuclei was achieved in the presence of X-gal (Fig. 5, far left panels). We also adapted the assay to allow the \u03b2-gal colorimetric substrates CPRG and ONPG to be used (Fig. 5, second left and middle panels). These changes, and resulting VNAb titres, were recorded using a microplate reader, reading at 550 nm (CPRG) or 405 nm (ONPG), or simply by eye. The incorporation of lacZ is an additional option to the much used GFP and luciferase reporter genes, which allow a more high-throughput approach but at a far greater expense (Fig. 5, second right and far right panels, respectively).",

On the contrary, dog vaccination programs have been enormously successful in controlling canine rabies [35\u201337], and improved diagnostics to enable rapid serosurveillance in countries undertaking these programs are therefore important. The assay reported here offers a practical, effective and robust solution for rapid lyssavirus serosurveillance. Using lentiviral pseudotypes we can accurately measure the concentration of VNAbs and, coupled with the use of lacZ as the reporter gene for pseudotype particle production, removes the need for high containment laboratories and expensive equipment or reagents. This allows the assay to be undertaken in laboratories previously unable to use the existing FAVN. Furthermore, the assay is not just restricted to lyssavirus serosurveillance as other highly pathogenic viruses that have been pseudotyped could be incorporated into this platform [24,38\u201341].",

Of the 319 samples received, titres for three could not be determined using the pseudotype assay: one had low level contamination and two caused cellular cytotoxicity in the assay. These issues were overcome using higher concentrations of antibiotics and increasing the number of BHK cells used 2-fold, to 2 \u00d7 104 per assay. In comparison, there were 12 samples that could not be titrated with the FAVN assay because of insufficient serum volume. While serum volume varied between samples, there was sufficient volume for each sample to run duplicate pseudotype neutralisation assays. This highlights another major advantage of using pseudotypes as surrogate viruses in neutralisation assays, only small serum volumes (5\u201310-fold less than live virus assays) are required for each assay.",

For this study, luciferase-based CVS-11 pseudotypes were used, which allowed high-throughput screening of the samples. This permitted many plates to be analysed in a short period, however, both the luciferase reagent and the plate reader are expensive. In contrast, the reagent for the lacZ reporter system is over 30 times less expensive than that for luciferase and 3 times less expensive than the fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate used in the FAVN assay. Additionally, as neutralisation assays using pseudotypes are safer, not requiring BSL3/SAPO 4 facilities, the overall cost of using them is many fold lower compared to performing the FAVN assay, thereby allowing expansion of rabies serosurveillance in resource-limited laboratories. In addition, since pseudotypes carrying the lacZ reporter can be detected using X-gal, CPRG or ONPG, the flexibility of the assay is further increased. With colorimetric substrates it is possible to record VNAb titres by simply looking at the assay plate and recording the colour change. Neutralisation assays using pseudotypes with lacZ as the reporter can also be used for semi-high-throughput screening when using an ELI-SPOT (X-gal staining) or microplate reader (CPRG and ONPG staining). However, the flexibility offered by packaging lacZ, GFP or luciferase into the pseudotype particle alone makes this assay an attractive option for use in any laboratory undertaking lyssavirus serosurveillance.",

If the stocks of pseudotype particles were to be thawed and re-frozen or to be stored at temperatures below \u221280 \u00b0C, they would still be viable for use in subsequent neutralisation assays. This is a major advantage over live virus, where the virus titre decreases rapidly on freeze-thaw or storage above \u221280 \u00b0C. However, where possible stocks of pseudotypes should be maintained at \u221280 \u00b0C and stored in aliquots to reduce the number of times each vial is thawed.

However, 17 discordant results were observed between the pseudotype and FAVN assays, which can partially be explained by the fact that they were all close to the 0.5 IU/ml threshold. Assay variability with the FAVN assay means that samples scoring 0.5 IU/ml had a variable range of 0.38\u20130.66 IU/ml if the test was repeated. Twelve out of these 17 samples that had a 0.5 IU/ml titre in the FAVN assay might have been classified as negative if re-tested, which would result in a new sensitivity score of 98.3%. Conversely, it is also possible that the scores of 0.38\u20130.66 IU/ml obtained with the FAVN assay and the corresponding titres achieved using the pseudotype assay could change if re-tested. It is worth noting the 17 dogs that were classified as having inadequate VNAb responses using the pseudotype assay, in disagreement with the FAVN results, were sampled before vaccination in this trial. In addition, 10 out of the 17 samples were from dogs with no history of previous rabies vaccination and 6 had been vaccinated \u22651 year before the study began, therefore their levels of VNAbs could have decreased over time. One did not have a vaccination history collected during the trial (#3). These discordant results coupled with neutralisation data showing DUVV pseudotypes can detect VNAb in anti-DUVV serum not detected by the FAVN assay suggests that the pseudotype assay may be more specific and sensitive for detection of seroconversion than the FAVN assay when a 0.5 IU/ml cut-off is used. However, to confirm this observation further studies are required using analogous viral isolates and serum, and larger sample sizes.",

We have addressed these limitations by developing an assay that can be used for infectious disease serosurveillance and for monitoring vaccine responses within low-containment laboratories. Neutralisation assays based on pseudotypes as a source of target antigen are a useful platform to use at the start of a new outbreak, not only for rabies, but also other enveloped RNA viruses such as SARS coronaviruses, influenza and Ebola viruses.
