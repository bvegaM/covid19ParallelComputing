The difference in sugar conformation between these monosaccharides does not appear to affect interactions with GRFT, since O1 points away from the protein chain. Similarly, the acetyl group of N-acetylglucosamine is directed away from the protein (Fig. 2B). In isothermal titration calorimetry binding experiments with GRFT, interaction heats were detected for both glucose and N-acetylglucosamine. These heats of interaction were comparable to that of mannose (Fig. 3), with a 1.5-fold decrease for glucose and a twofold decrease for N-acetylglucosamine (Table 2). In binding experiments with other monosaccharides to GRFT, only minimal or no heats of interaction were detected (data not shown). However, a subtle but important difference between mannose and either glucose or N-acetylglucosamine was detected in the calorimetry binding experiments. As was previously reported (Zi\u00f3\u0142kowska et al. 2007), binding between mannose and GRFT was fully saturable (Kd = 102 \u03bcM). In the case of glucose and N-acetylglucosamine, although interaction heats were detected for both these monosaccharides, saturation of binding was not achieved, and as such, values for the enthalpy of binding and binding affinity could not be numerically derived.",

A single molecule of N-acetylglucosamine was found in site 6 of the GRFT dimer, whereas other sites were occupied by different ligands present in the mother liquor, such as ethylene glycol (site 5), sulfate (sites 1 and 4), and water (site 2). Site 3 is involved in intermolecular contacts and is not accessible to soaked ligands. Preferential binding of a carbohydrate molecule in site 6 simply indicates easier accessibility, since all six sites are occupied by N-acetylglucosamine in the new cocrystal structure, and the conformation of sugar molecules is similar to that found in the complex with mannose. Additionally, there is a significant difference between the orientation of N-acetylglucosamine in binding site 6 in both the soaked and cocrystal structures (Fig. 2C). The soaked structure was refined at 2.0 \u00c5 resolution, whereas the cocrystal form was refined at 1.56 \u00c5, giving more detailed information and showing clear indications of the presence of both \u03b1 and \u03b2 anomers of N-acetylglucosamine in all six binding sites, with the former predominating.",

Soaking experiments were performed repeatedly with varied concentrations of different ligands and resulted in no carbohydrate binding at lower concentration, and in destruction of the crystals when sugar concentration was raised. Thus the previously reported structure of a complex with N-acetylglucosamine obtained by soaking resulted from an irreproducible experiment in which at least some binding could be seen before crystals were destroyed. Although sulfates occupied some of the carbohydrate-binding sites in the soaked structure, sulfate concentration in the cocrystallization experiments was actually significantly higher. The differences between the structures obtained by soaking versus cocrystallization point out why the latter, if feasible, is by far a preferred method of preparing ligand complexes.",

The fact that the calorimetric results reported here and those from an earlier study with disaccharides (Zi\u00f3\u0142kowska et al. 2006) show a thermodynamic preference for mannose and 1 \u2192 6\u03b1-mannobiose over glucose and maltose, respectively, indicates that further studies are necessary to determine the biophysical source of this preference. Since previously published data (Mori et al. 2005) indicated that mannose was four- to fivefold better than glucose or N-acetylglucosamine at inhibiting the binding of GRFT to HIV gp120, the functional importance of further investigating this dichotomy is clear.",

All data were processed and scaled using the HKL2000 package (Otwinowski and Minor 1997). The structures of both complexes were solved by molecular replacement with PHASER (Storoni et al. 2004) using as a model the coordinates of GRFT dimer from the complex with mannose refined at 1.78 \u00c5 resolution (PDB code 2guc) (Zi\u00f3\u0142kowska et al. 2006). For the complex with glucose, a solution was found with the Z-score of 15.7 after rotation function search and 23.5 after translation function search, and resulted in R = 0.267 and Rfree = 0.288 after a single run of restrained refinement with no rebuilding. The solution for the complex with N-acetylglucosamine was found with the Z-score of 14.3 after rotation function and 27.7 after translation function, and with R = 0.231 and Rfree = 0.318 after the first run of restrained refinement. The structures were further rebuilt with COOT (Emsley and Cowtan 2004) and refined with REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al. 1997). The results of the refinement are summarized in Table 1.
