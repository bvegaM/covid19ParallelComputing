There is currently no psychometrically-validated scale to assess influences on workers' adherence. After the data collection was conducted, Michinov et al.

The aim of the present study was to develop and test the psychometric properties of such a scale. Forty nine items were derived from interviews with 29 nurses and tested across two studies. Study 1 was a repeated-measures survey using principal components analysis with data from 363 participants; a 29 item, five factor solution was extracted with good to acceptable internal reliabilities (\u03b1 = .61-.85). Data from 122 of the original participants retested at 4 weeks showed intraclass correlations of .69-.84.",

In 1996, UP were revised and renamed standard precaution guidelines (SP) (Garner, 1996) .

They emphasized that most of those measures assessed adherence/non-adherence rates, and recommended that \"further research [to] assess the variables that influence adherence to SP\" (p. 1516). Attempts to date to determine the reasons for non-adherence to SP among health-care workers have typically used only single items (Lam, 2014; Rabaud et al., 2000; Valim, Marziale, Richart-Mart\u00ednez, & Sanjuan-Quiles, 2014) or observational and anecdotal accounts. These latter accounts indicate that a lack of knowledge, lack of or inadequate supplies, time pressure, confidence in their own skills, the organizational climate, and forgetfulness are among the factors that staff have cited as their reasons for non-adherence (Efstathiou, Papastavrou, Raftopoulos, & Merkouris, 2011b; Hills & Wilkes, 2003; Reda, Fisseha, Mengistie, & Vandeweerd, 2010) . Furthermore, Efstathiou et al. (2011b) highlighted that most studies discussing non-adherence to Standard Precautions \"studied only one or limited aspects of SP, mainly hand hygiene\" (p. 2). Some attempts to broaden the range of factors argued to assess adherence to SP can be found in the work of Osborne (2003) and Cheung et al. (2015) ; however, neither study provided detailed items nor any psychometric data beyond Cronbach's alpha. It is important, therefore, to develop and psychometrically validate a scale that systematically assesses a range of factors influencing adherence or non-adherence to SP. The aim of the present study was to develop and validate such a scale. We report on two studies designed to achieve this aim.",

Such judgements are outside the guidelines. Furthermore, nurses who make these judgements not only ignore patient safety but might also be perceived as having some level of invincibility, that is, they will not be at risk. A sense of invincibility has been linked with risk-taking behavior in the leisure context (Roberts & Kennedy, 2006; Wickman & Koniak-Griffin, 2013) , and it might be that those exhibiting this personality trait might also exhibit it in other areas, including the workplace. This factor aligns with Efstathiou et al.'s (2011b) finding that nurses who failed to follow some or all of the guidelines stated they did so because they had confidence in their capabilities and enough experience to make a judgement about the situation. It is encouraging that the mean score on this factor in the current sample was reasonably low (mean = 6.58, range 0-20).",

BBV = blood-borne virus; PPE = personal protective equipment; R = reverse coded Item; SP = standard precaution guidelines blood-borne virus (BBV) might also be a determinant, as would knowing that the organizational culture supports SP use. Such cues seem to encourage individuals to adopt SP and might lead to the behaviors becoming habitual, that is, behavior repeated until it has become more or less automatic (Nilsen, Roback, Brostrom, & Ellstrom, 2012) . Certainly, Neal, Wood, Wu, and Kurlander (2011) showed that habits can be activated directly by contextual cues that are outside the individual's overt sense of awareness, although this factor was not highly endorsed by current participants (mean = 13.01, range 0-24). The presence of positive or negative cues, such as knowledge of a patient's BBV status or lack of available PPE, has been described previously as factors influencing adherence to SP (Cutter & Jordan, 2012; Madan, Raafat, Hunt et al., 2002; Tait et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2008) , although using one's knowledge of a patient's status to decide whether or not to use SP is against the basic premise of mandated SP use.",

For instance, not using gloves was justified on the basis that their use makes for a more clumsy execution of the task, that staff had trained for tasks without using gloves, and that wearing gloves reduces tactile feelings. These comments support Cutter and Jordan's (2012) , Gammon, Morgan-Samuel, and Gould's (2008) , and Tait et al.'s (2000) research, where they reported that staff refrained from using PPE, such as gloves, due to their perception that PPE interfered with their skilled delivery of clinical procedures or increased their workload due to a need to repeat procedures. Interestingly, in a study of cannulation failure rates, Zhang, Lee, and Knott (2014) found no difference in whether or not participants used gloves, suggesting that glove use did not impede the administrator's skill, thus negating this justification. However, they did find that participants who did not use gloves reported more incidents related to significant blood spillage than those who did use gloves.",
