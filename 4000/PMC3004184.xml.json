Of the 4 coronavirus strains tested, the more newly discovered NL63 and HKU1 showed consistent disease-associated significance in all statistical analyses. The conferred risk for neuropsychiatric disease by coronavirus immunoreactivity was modestly elevated as evident by ORs of 1.3 for HKU1 and 2.4 for NL63. When the patient group was broken down into mood and schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, however, the OR for NL63 association with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders increased to 3.1.

Schizoaffective disorder, which has a mood disorder component, accounted for 15% (n = 8) of those with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Our data show a lack of association of NL63 with mood disorders; therefore, if individuals with schizoaffective disorder were suffering more from the mood component of their disease at the time of the blood draw, then our OR measures are actually conservative estimates for disease association. It is also possible that diagnostic uncertainty present close to the start of an illness with psychotic symptoms may have led to some misclassifications. For example, differentiating bipolar disorder with psychotic features from schizoaffective disorder may not always be 100% accurate. Within-group distributions also may have influenced study outcome in the mood disorder subgrouping where 30.2% (n = 16) of the patients suffered from major depression and the remainder from subtypes of bipolar disorder.",

For each serum sample, the antibodies measured represent an immunological profile based on a single time point, and therefore, data can only be analyzed in a cross sectional manner. Future studies that incorporate a prospective design will allow the assessment of changes in antibody levels over time and will enable us to ascertain the utility of this antibody measure as a diagnostic tool and/or etiological agent. Another potentially limiting factor may be that the inclusion/exclusion criteria for our control group led to a sample that may not be fully representative of persons in the general population. The net effect of our recruitment of volunteers who were excluded from having Axis 1 disorders, viral infections, or antiviral therapy may in fact be a control group that was unusually healthy. An ideal control group would be composed of individuals with nonpsychotic learning or developmental disorders who live similar lifestyles as those who go on to develop mental disorders with psychotic symptoms. With respect to the exclusion of current viral infections and antiviral medications in the control but not in the patient group, any virus showing coinfection with the coronaviruses could potentially bias the results in favor of a spurious association. Of note, we performed a similar evaluation of the influenza A and B viruses in these populations, and differences in antibody levels between patients and controls were not detected (data not shown), thus providing some evidence against an intergroup unequal exposure rate hypothesis, at least for respiratory viruses. In the future, additional control groups should be evaluated to determine the prevalence of coronavirus infections in a wide range of human populations. As a starting point, though, use of such a control population here is appropriate because to the authors\u2019 knowledge coronaviruses have never before been tested for a serological association with patients with these particular disorders.",

Because subjects in the control group were older, had mothers with fewer years of education, and smoked less, we adjusted our multivariate analyses for factors such as age, socioeconomic status, and smoking. Nevertheless, other epidemiological explanations could account for the increased exposure rates observed for the patient group, with multiple environmental factors likely contributing to comorbid health conditions in those who are mentally ill.

More investigation is needed to determine if respiratory infection and subsequent neuroinvasion could explain the association of increased coronavirus seroprevalence and the recent onset of psychotic symptoms. It is of note that cinanserin, a serotonin antagonist originally developed for the treatment of schizophrenia, has recently been shown to have the ability to inhibit the replication of a wide range of coronaviruses.44,45 A better understanding of the role of coronaviruses in the etiopathogenesis of disorders with psychotic symptoms might lead to new methods for studying, diagnosing, and treating these diseases.",
