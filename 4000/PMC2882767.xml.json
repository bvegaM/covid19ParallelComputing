Coronaviruses have been identified as the causative agent of many animal and human diseases (Rota et al., 2003 \u25b6). On the basis of antigenic cross-reactivity and sequence similarity, coronaviruses have been assigned into three groups, with human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) being representatives of groups I, II and III, respectively. MHV, which causes liver or neuron infections in mice, was the best-studied coronavirus (both in vivo and in vitro) prior to the 2003 SARS outbreak.",

The virus produces nine genes encoding 11 proteins that could be recognized as structural proteins and non-structural proteins (nsps) and are crucial for viral RNA synthesis (Sturman & Holmes, 1983 \u25b6). The genomic RNA is encapsidated by the nucleocapsid (N) protein into the capsid core. The other four structural proteins, consisting of the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) proteins, surround the capsid core to form the crown-like viral particles (Sturman & Holmes, 1983 \u25b6).",

            "text": "The MHV-A59 N protein (MHV-N) is well conserved across the various MHV strains. It interacts with the 30.4 kb genomic RNA to form the helical nucleocapsid (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2004 \u25b6; Baric et al., 1988 \u25b6; Macneughton & Davies, 1978 \u25b6; Robbins et al., 1986 \u25b6; Sawicki et al., 2005 \u25b6) and associates with the membrane glycoprotein via its C-\u00adterminal part to stabilize virion assembly (Bednar et al., 2006 \u25b6; Hurst et al., 2005 \u25b6; Kuo & Masters, 2002 \u25b6; Verma et al., 2006 \u25b6). It is also considered to be an RNA chaperone (Mir & Panganiban, 2006 \u25b6; Z\u00fa\u00f1iga et al., 2007 \u25b6). The N protein of MHV-A59 has been determined to be a highly basic phosphoprotein with a molecular weight of 55 kDa that can be subdivided into three conserved domains: domains I (residues Met1\u2013Ala139) and II (residues Asp163\u2013Gln380) are basic, while the C-terminal domain III (residues Glu406\u2013Val454) is acidic. A general RNA-binding region is located at residues His136\u2013Arg397 (Cologna et al., 2000 \u25b6; Masters, 1992 \u25b6; Mir & Panganiban, 2006 \u25b6; You et al., 2007 \u25b6), while the conserved negatively charged amino acids in domain III are believed to play an important role in N\u2013M protein interactions during assembly (Bednar et al., 2006 \u25b6; Hurst et al., 2005 \u25b6; Kuo & Masters, 2002 \u25b6; Verma et al., 2006 \u25b6). To date, no complete nucleocapsid protein structure has been reported, although the structure of the N-terminal domain (NTD; PDB code 3hd4; Grossoehme et al., 2009 \u25b6) of MHV N protein has been determined. However, the structure of the C-terminal domain (CTD) remains elusive. This work will help to finally determine the structure of the CTD.",

The seeding method involved microseeding combined with streak-seeding. In brief, the protocol used was as follows. We picked up some initial crystals and suspended them as a slurry in mother liquor (1.6 M sodium citrate pH 6.5). We then crushed them by vibration into invisible seeds. The seed slurry was diluted to 0.5\u00d7, 0.1\u00d7, 0.05\u00d7 and 0.01\u00d7 concentrations in order to form a suitable concentration-screening matrix. We then dipped a cat whisker into the diluted seed slurry and streaked the whisker across a pre-equilibrated drop under the optimum condition (1.3 M sodium citrate pH 6.5). This procedure was repeated for all the different concentrations of seed slurry. Finally, high-quality well shaped crystals were obtained (Fig. 1 \u25b6).",

Diffraction data were collected on an ADSC Q270 detector at 100 K at a wavelength of 1.0000 \u00c5 and were processed to 2.20 \u00c5 resolution using the HKL-2000 program suite (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997 \u25b6); the crystal belonged to space group P422, with unit-cell parameters a = 66.6, c = 50.8 \u00c5. No potential rotational symmetry was revealed on checking the diffraction extinctions. Based on the molecular weight of the monomer, the Matthews coefficient (Matthews, 1968 \u25b6) was calculated to be 2.16 \u00c53 Da\u22121 and the solvent content was 43.0%, assuming the presence of two molecules per asymmetric unit. Data-collection statistics are shown in Table 1 \u25b6. A typical diffraction image of the MHV-N CTD crystal is shown in Fig. 2 \u25b6.",
