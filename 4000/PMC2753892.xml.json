Furthermore, the release of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 was mostly dependent on the activation of the ERK-1/2 MAPK and JNK pathways and, to a lesser extent, the p38 MAPK and NF-\u03baB pathways. The pathology induced by L2-MHV3 is related to the release of intrahepatic IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 via the TLR2 receptor, as demonstrated in Tlr2\u2212/\u2212 mice and by histopathological observations.",

Resident peritoneal macrophages were purified from uninfected C57BL/6 and Tlr2\u2212/\u2212 mice and infected further in vitro with L2-MHV3 for 24 hr, and pro-inflammatory cytokines were then quantified. Results indicated that the production of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 was not induced in Tlr2\u2212/\u2212 peritoneal macrophages infected with L2-MHV3 compared with C57BL/6 infected cells (P < 0\u00b7001 for both cytokines) (Fig. 4a,b). The addition of a functional grade TLR2 mAb partially impaired IL-6 (P < 0\u00b7001) and TNF-\u03b1 (P < 0\u00b705) production by resident C57BL/6 peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 4c,d). The partial effect was attributable to the intrinsic properties of the TLR2 mAb, as specified by eBioscience. These results thus confirmed that TLR2 molecules are involved in the induction of a pro-inflammatory response during an MHV3 infection.",

Pretreatment of uninfected or MHV3-infected peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 mice with the AgB10 mAb did not induce or inhibit the production of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1. Furthermore, addition of an inhibitor to SHP-1, implicated in the CEACAM1a signalling pathway,43 did not impair cytokine production by C57BL/6 macrophages. These results demonstrated that CEACAM1a is not involved in the induction of the production of inflammatory cytokines by MHV3-infected macrophages. However, this conclusion does not totally exclude the possibility that cytokine production may be associated with intracellular pathways related to CEACAM1a, as demonstrated by a slight increase of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in macrophages from C57BL/6 mice treated with the SHP-1 inhibitor. The production of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in SJL-derived macrophages also indicates that CEACAM1b is not also involved. However, it has been reported that incubation of dendritic cells with a specific CEACAM1a mAb (AgB10) promotes the release of various chemokines and cytokines, such as macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b1, MIP-2, IL-6 and IL-12, and increases the expression of the costimulatory molecules CD40, CD54, CD80 and CD86 on these cells.42 CEACAM1a pro-inflammatory properties may be differently regulated in different cell types.",

This observation suggests that MHV3 may use heparan sulphate or a closely related receptor to induce the production of cytokines by macrophages, rather than the CEACAM1a receptor. In fact, the production of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 by MHV3-infected peritoneal macrophages is induced by viral fixation to a receptor located in regions enriched in heparan sulphate but not by viral replication, as demonstrated by experiments using viruses with denaturated S protein or UV-inactivated viruses. Thus, denaturation of viral S protein by incubation at pH 8\u00b70 and 37\u00b0 inhibited the production of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, whereas UV inactivation of MHV3, which does not alter viral fixation to the cell surface but inhibits efficient viral replication (confirmed by MHV3 immunolabelling), did not impair the production of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in C57BL/6 or Ceacam1a\u2212/\u2212 peritoneal macrophages. Therefore, these results revealed that viral replication is not essential for induction of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 and that the presence of the viral S protein is sufficient to stimulate production of cytokines by macrophages.",

These results also suggest that viruses that possess glycoproteins and an envelope, such as coronaviruses, may induce a strong inflammatory response directly by their fixation to TLRs and membranes enriched in heparan sulphate via the S protein or by their release of free S proteins, without viral replication. The PPR role of the TLRs and the heparan sulphate receptor in the presence of infectious viruses demonstrated a new viral mechanism for amplification of the inflammatory response, thus explaining the severity of diseases induced by human or mouse coronaviruses. Cytokine regulation in coronavirus infections has been poorly explored. Our results indicate that MHV3 is a powerful model for such studies. We have demonstrated that the murine coronavirus MHV3 can stimulate the production of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 by activating TLR2/heparan sulphate regions at the cell surface of macrophages. In addition, these results suggest an interesting mechanism by which a virus and its viral surface proteins may regulate the immune response in addition to viral replication in macrophages.",
