Among these, sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) is ranked seventh in importance and is characterized with fleshy, tuberous roots. Over recent years, considerable progress has been made in the isolation and characterization of genes associated with storage proteins, such as starch biosynthesis proteins (Wang et al., 1999) and stress-related proteins (Wang et al., 1995; Yeh et al., 1997a, b; Yao et al., 2001; Jih et al., 2003). In order to understand how tuberous roots are developed, studies on morphogenesis have been carried out over a considerable period of time (Lowe and Wilson, 1974). Such work has clearly demonstrated that tuberous roots are originated from the activation of primary cambia, along with anomalous cambial activity in the secondary and vascular cambia. During the secondary-thickening growth, the procambial ring gradually aligns outwardly; meanwhile, parenchyma cells inside become highly proliferated and finally differentiate into starch-storage cells.",

            "text": "The initiation of organized development is a complex morphogenetic phenomenon, in which extrinsic and intrinsic factors play important roles (Aswath and Kim, 2005). Inputs from environmental cues, hormone signals and nutrient status are driving factors during organogenesis. In addition, the internal balance of plant hormones such as abscisic acid (ABA) and cytokinins is crucial to the phase transition and tuber development (Matsuo, 1983; Wang et al., 2005). Such developmental programs mostly rely on the spatial and temporal regulation of transcription factors. Although many attempts have been made to identify genes involved in the formation of tuberous roots (You et al., 2003; Tanaka et al., 2004), there is still a paucity of molecular investigations on upstream regulators, such as MADS-box transcription factors.",

            "text": "The term \u2018MADS\u2019 is derived from Minichromosomal maintenance 1 (MCM1), Agamous (AG), Deficiens (DEF) and Serum response factor (SRF) genes. These MADS-box transcription factors are named after a conserved N-terminal DNA binding domain (Garcia-Maroto et al., 2003). Many of the plant MADS-box proteins are MIKC-type, including another conserved region that resembles the coiled-coil structure of keratin (K box), and two variable segments, the I region and C terminus (Pa\u0159enicov\u00e1 et al., 2003). In planta, MADS-box transcription factors have been found extensively in floral organ differentiation, giving their function through either homo- or hetero-dimerization and transactivation (Kaufmann et al., 2005). As a result, the \u2018ABCDE model\u2019 was proposed (Thei\u00dfen, 2001; Theissen and Melzer, 2007). In addition to floral morphogenesis, recent findings have provided more evidence of MADS-box transcription factors in vegetative development (Rounsley et al., 1995; Heard et al., 1997; Carmona et al., 1998; Montiel et al., 2004). MADS-box genes of the SQUA (SQUAMOSA) subfamily appear to have a widespread expression pattern in both floral and vegetative organs. For example, POTM1 (potato MADS-box 1) of potato (Kang and Hannapel, 1996) regulates the transitional phases from vegetative meristem to inflorescence meristem (Hart and Hannapel, 2002). In contrast, some subfamilies exhibit a strong tendency in vegetative expression; potato STMADS11 and STMADS16 (Carmona et al., 1998; Garcia-Maroto et al., 2000) in the STMADS11 subfamily are one example in promoting vegetative growth. AGL17 (Agamous-like 17) subfamily members, including NMHC5, DEFH125, ANR1, AGL16, AGL17 and AGL21 (Rounsley et al., 1995; Heard et al., 1997; Zhang and Forde, 1998; Alvarez-Buylla et al., 2000; Burgeff et al., 2002), are also specifically related to vegetative morphogenesis. As an example, ANR1 is related to lateral root development in response to nitrate (Zhang and Forde, 1998; Alvarez-Buylla et al., 2000). Thus far, MADS-box transcription factors have been verified as participating in diverged functional networks.",

Total RNA was isolated from leaves, roots and developing tuberous roots at different stages of growth: <2 g total plant fresh weight, 5\u201310 g, and approx. 50 g. The first and second strand cDNA synthesis was carried out with a SuperScript\u2122 lambda system kit (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). After double digestion of cDNA by AseI and TaqI, adaptors were ligated to restriction fragments for preamplification PCR. The resulting products were taken as templates in the selective amplification procedure. Combinatory PCR primer pairs, 5\u2032-GACTGCGTACCTAATNN-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-ATGAGTCCTGACCGANN-3\u2032, were designed according to preamplication primers with two base extentions (denoted as NN). Radioactive labelling of primers with [\u03b3-33P] ATP was performed as described by Vos et al. (1995). The amplified products were resolved on a 1 % sequencing gel and visualized by autoradiography at appropriate times. Differentially expressed transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) in early tuberous root samples were excised from the sequencing gel and rescued for sequencing. One particular TDF, TDF26-1, was further chosen for 5\u2032-rapid amplification of the cDNA ends (5\u2032-RACE) and 3\u2032-RACE in order to reconstruct the full cDNA sequence by an overlapping method. The derived cDNA sequence of IbMADS1 has been deposited into the NCBI Genbank data library under accession number AF396746 (2001), together with its corresponding amino acid sequence as AAK83920 (2001).",

            "text": "It is well known that tuberization is controlled by several plant hormones (Wang et al., 2005). Three kinds of tuberization-related hormones, ABA, JA and cytokinins, were tested for IbMADS1 responsiveness. Fibrous roots were cultured in MS liquid media containing various concentrations of plant hormones for 3 h. ABA showed a relatively weak effect on IbMADS1 induction (Fig. 3A), whereas the IbMADS1 transcription level accumulated in accordance with increasing concentration of JA and BA, reaching a maximal expression level at 200 \u00b5m (Fig. 3A). Combinations of JA and BA at lower concentrations were applied in a long-term culture for in vitro tuberization. After 6 weeks of cultivation, several swellings with tuber-like appearance were observed from the fibrous roots under the hormone combination of 10 \u00b5m JA and 10 \u00b5m BA (Fig. 3B) as well as the combination of 10 \u00b5m JA and 20 \u00b5m BA (data not shown), whereas JA or BA alone at the concentrations tested (1, 10, 20, 50 \u00b5m) were not sufficient to initiate tuberous swellings on roots (data not shown). In accordance with tuberous root initiation, IbMADS1 transcripts were detected copiously in the swollen root tissues (Fig. 3B). Up-regulation of two tuber marker genes, sporamin (Yeh et al., 1997a, b) and IbAGPase (Wang et al., 1999), was also detected (Fig. 3B). The former gene encodes the major storage protein, sporamin, in tuberous roots of sweet potato (Maeshima et al., 1987; Yeh et al., 1997a, b), whilst the latter encodes AGPase for ADP-glucose production in starch biosynthesis during tuber development. The result thus suggest a close correlation between IbMADS1 expression and tuber morphogenesis.",

            "text": "Two close relatives of sweet potato, Ipomoea leucantha (diploid) and I. trifida (diploid, tetraploid, hexaploid), have been considered as the putative progenitors of sweet potato without tuberous root formation (Saranya et al., 2006). In order to investigate IbMADS1 homologues among Ipomoea species, Southern and Northern hybridizations were carried out with an IbMADS1-specific probe. Since this probe contained neither the EcoRI nor HindIII restriction site, the Southern blot could reflect the theoretical number of IbMADS1 homologues in the genome. In genomic analysis (Fig. 4A), hexaploid sweet potato exhibited multiple hybridization signals, while diploid I. leucantha and diploid I. trifida displayed a low copy number within the genome. As for Arabidopsis and potato, no hybridization signal was detected (data not shown). At the transcriptional level, IbMADS1 transcripts were detectable in the fibrous roots of sweet potato, and showed highest accumulation at the stage of early tuber formation (Fig. 4B, T<5). In contrast, the expression level of the IbMADS1 homologue was too low to be detected in all tissues examined from I. leucantha and I. trifida (Fig. 4B). The results showed that the expression of IbMADS1 was tuber organ-dependent. Moreover, IbMADS1 seemed to be specifically expressed in sweet potato among Ipomoea species. Subsequently, in situ hybridization was performed to localize the transcripts of IbMADS1 in fibrous roots of sweet potato (Fig. 5); signals in blue-purple indicate the location of IbMADS1 transcripts. In transverse sections, signals were mostly restricted to the stele, especially around the primary cambium (Fig. 5B). In a magnified view, IbMADS1 was observed to be clearly localized in the emerging lateral root primordium (Fig. 5D) and immature meristematic cells such as the protoxylem and protopholem within the root stele (Fig. 5E). As lateral roots protruded, signals were similarly found in immature vascular cells (data not shown). The tissue-specific and cell-specific expression pattern strongly indicated that the functional role of IbMADS1 was closely related to tuberization process.",

On the other hand, fibrous roots displayed unusual root tip swellings (data not shown) and partial bulking along the root axial in transgenic lines (Fig. 6B); the swollen size was approx. 50 % larger than the native roots from macroscopic observations (Fig. 6A, B). Anatomical data showed that the typical triarch pattern in the potato root stele (Fig. 6C) was altered into an anomalous poly-arch pattern in the swollen portion of transgenic potato roots (Fig. 6D). Measurements of the root width indicated that the stele enlarged from 84\u00b73 \u00b1 6\u00b74 \u00b5m to 132\u00b75 \u00b1 16\u00b70 \u00b5m, with the cortex region expanding from 234\u00b71 \u00b1 52\u00b78 \u00b5m to 374\u00b75 \u00b1 80\u00b72 \u00b5m.

Cells in the stele with a differentiated secondary cell wall were counted for quantitative analyses. The multiplication of metaxylem cells from an average of 40\u00b73 \u00b1 3\u00b74 to 82\u00b73 \u00b1 6\u00b73 seemed to be the main cause for stele expansion (Fig. 7B). Meanwhile, the rest of the parenchyma cells within stele changed in number from 187\u00b77 \u00b1 16\u00b78 to 204\u00b78 \u00b1 10\u00b76.",

It was evident that IbMADS1 was preferentially expressed in early developing tuberous roots, but not in flowers or leaves (Fig. 4B). In fibrous roots, IbMADS1 expression was mainly restricted to young vascular cells around the procambium, such as the primary xylem and primary phloem (Fig. 5B, E) and the primordia portion of emerging branch roots (Fig. 5D). This implies that active expression of IbMADS1 might trigger a signal-transduction pathway of cell proliferation and cell growth, that would subsequently cause the outgrowth expansion of stele. The transduction signal might also activate starch biosynthetic genes to fulfill the storage function of the tissue. Our observations of IbMADS1 expression in root vascular cells appear to coincide with previous reports on tuber morphogenesis (Lowe and Wilson, 1974).",

            "text": "Plant hormones play a critical role during tuberous root initiation and development in sweet potato, for example cytokinins are essential throughout the tuberization process (Gan et al., 2001). The effect of JA on root pigmentation is an early initializing signal for tuberous root formation (Gan et al., 2001), while ABA is mainly associated with cell differentiation in the vascular cambium at later developmental stages (Wang et al., 2005). The relatively strong induction by JA and relatively weak induction by ABA indicate the role of IbMADS1 in mediating the initial tuberization stage. This finding matches the expression pattern of IbMADS1 in sweet potato (Fig. 4B). To further determine the relationship, we successfully established an in vitro system to initiate tuberous roots by means of long-term hormone culture (Fig. 3B). The outcome was similar to what was reported by Nakatani (1994) in that IbMADS1 was up-regulated in the bulking portion of the sweet potato roots (Fig. 3B). Two tuber marker genes, sporamin (Yeh et al., 1997a, b) and AGPase (Wang et al., 1999), were concomitantly expressed in the organs (Fig. 3B). The synergistic effect of cytokinins and JA on the onset of tuberization seems to be closely correlated with active expression of IbMADS1.",

As a MADS-box gene member, IbMADS1 was expressed mainly in early the tuberization stages of root tissues in sweet potato, whereas no transcript was detected in any examined tissue from I. leucantha and I. trifida (Fig. 4B). IbMADS1 homologues may exist as silenced genes in the genomes of the two tuber-deficient Ipomoea relatives (Fig. 4A). A reasonable explanation of the novel character of extant sweet potato, i.e. the ability to form tuberous roots, is that it is because of cross-hybridization between Ipomoea species and self-polyploidization within the sweet potato genome \u2013 IbMADS1 being activated in this process. From an evolutionary perspective, we therefore propose that the active expression of IbMADS1 is of great importance in conferring a physiological function related to tuberous root formation in sweet potato.",

            "text": "To date, many plant MADS-box transcription factors have been reported in controlling flowering processes and floral organ identity (Kaufmann et al., 2005). Therefore, an attempt was made to express IbMADS1 in Arabidopsis; however, we have not been able to find notable morphological alterations in the floral organ and flowering time (data not shown). As an alternative, we employed potato as the heterologous expression system in this study: potato already has a well-established plant transformation system, and the tuberization mechanisms in potato and sweet potato supposedly share general features and perhaps a general signal pathway. Although the origins of the tuber organs are different, potato tubers are analogous to sweet potato tuberous roots in many physiological aspects. For example, similar environmental and endogenous factors, such as high cytokinins and low nitrogen (Wilson and Lowe, 1973), will result in tuberization in both potato and sweet potato. According to the reports of Artschwager (1924) and Togari (1950), sweet potato tuberous roots were mostly derived from the structural precursors of pentarch or hexarch steles and enlarged apical meristems. Interestingly, the development of tuberous roots from adventitious roots with poly-arch steles in sweet potato pheno-copied the morphological alterations observed in transgenic potatoes expressing IbMADS1 (Fig. 6). Sweet potato experiences anomalous xylem proliferation from activated root procambium, especially at the beginning of tuberous root induction (Lowe and Wilson, 1974). In our histological study on transgenic potato, metaxylem doubling inside the stele of swollen roots (Fig. 7B) likewise demonstrated an enhanced activity in cell proliferation and xylem differentiation from young vascular cells. The resulting poly-arch steles in partially swollen roots (Fig. 6D) of transgenic potato occurred together with puffy root apical meristems at root tips in some cases (data not shown). In agreement with the above transgenic phenotypes, IbMADS1 may trigger the tuberization potential of potato roots by incorporation into the signal-transduction pathway to activate downstream genes. In this way, alterations in stem-derived potato tubers would have a chance to take place, as mentioned above (data not shown). Since three potato MADS-box genes, POTM1, STMADS11 and STMADS16, have been characterized with vegetative expression in roots and tubers (Kang and Hannapel, 1996; Carmona et al., 1998; Garcia-Maroto et al., 2000; Hart and Hannapel, 2002), we cannot exclude the interference of endogenous potato MADS-box genes; howevr, there are several arguments against such interference, as follows. First, STMADS11 and STMADS16 have no direct relationship with tuber morphogenesis. STMADS11 is suggested to be a vegetative regulator involved in sprout initiation at the dormant meristem within the potato tuber (Carmona et al., 1998). Ectopic expression of STMADS16 confers vegetative features to flowers and also promotes vegetative growth in internodes and hence stem elongation (Garcia-Maroto et al., 2000). Second, the axillary meristem has great plasticity to develop into shoots, stolons and tubers. POTM1 mediates axillary meristem development, but not initiation (Rosin et al., 2003). Suppression of POTM1 results in an activated axillary meristem, increased cytokinin content and reduced tuber formation (Rosin et al., 2003); however, morphological changes in either tuber or root have not been mentioned. Third, POTM1 is proposed to favour the development of a dominant sink organ by regulating hormone balance (Rosin et al., 2003). In this study (Fig. 3A), IbMADS1 expression was regulated by cytokinins, instead of acting as an upstream regulator. It is conceivable that IbMADS1 works differently from POTM1 in potato, although further investigation is required. In other words, IbMADS1 is anticipated to contribute to the proliferative potential in facilitating tuber organ initiation in both potato and sweet potato. In order to further demonstrate the function of IbMADS1, our future target is to characterize the tuber-forming potential of sweet potato in both over-expression and suppression lines. A transformation system for sweet potato is currently in progress based on our previous studies (Ashok Kumar et al., 2007).",

These MADS-box transcription factors may contribute to root development at different stages (Kim et al., 2005b). The expression of IbMADS3, IbMADS4 and IbMADS79 has been detected mainly in fibrous roots before tuberous root formation (Kim et al., 2002, 2005b), whilst IbAGL20 is constitutively expressed in all tissues (Kim et al., 2005b). IbMADS10 has been reported in relation to anthocyanin accumulation in both flowers and pigmented root periderm and cortex tissue (Lalusin et al., 2006). Our study has demonstrated that IbMADS1 was predominantly expressed in developing tuberous roots (Fig. 4B). The diversified expression patterns of these IbMADS genes in sweet potato suggest that partial functional redundancy is an evolutionary product, rather than simply coincidence. Parallel expressions in sweet potato MADS-box genes have been observed as fibrous roots developed into tuberous roots (Kim et al., 2005b). Root dry weight in sweet potato increased by a factor of five between 15 and 60 d after planting; at the stage of root thickening commencing at 40 d, IbMADS3, IbMADS4, IbAGL20 and IbMADS79 reached a maximal expression level (Kim et al., 2005b). Transcripts of IbMADS1 and IbAGL17 were still accumulating up to 50 d and then gradually decreased (Kim et al., 2005b). This phenomenon implies a promising mechanism linking vegetative IbMADS genes to the onset of tuberization. As proposed by Aswath and Kim (2005), co-ordinated expression of IbMADS1 with other vascular developmental genes is a hallmark of the complexity of tuberous root induction. Our data provide support to the link between IbMADS1 function and the tuberization process, providing an insight into the genetic network of IbMADS1 and other IbMADS genes during the course of root development. After being triggered by some hormone signals, such as cytokinins and JA, these IbMADS genes may co-operate by interacting in dimers or tetramers in order to initiate a signal-transduction cascade that is involved in tuberous root organogenesis. In conclusion, this study provides basic knowledge and concepts on developmental windows that should help in the future improvement of the yields of sweet potato and other tuber crops.",
