Although it has been recognized for some time that influenza viruses persist in the environment, this fact has been largely ignored until recently. Influenza viruses can remain viable on hard nonporous surfaces for up to 24 h, on tissues for up to 15 min, on hands for 5 min (4) and for at least 48 h on banknotes (5). Viral nucleic acid has been detected by polymerase chain reaction on several objects and surfaces in day care centres and homes (6). More recently, pH1N1 has been detected by polymerase chain reaction on a bedrail and computer mouse several days after admission and treatment of the infected patient (3). Hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions or potentially contaminated items, and cleaning of these items after exposure are important control measures. It is recommended that gloves be worn in health care settings, as well as a gown if soiling of clothing or skin with respiratory tract secretions is anticipated.",

Infection occurs by inoculation of the conjunctiva by contaminated fingers or ophthalmological equipment (7,8). Splashes of respiratory secretions into the eye during procedures such as suctioning may also be involved. It has been assumed that this may also apply to influenza. Wearing of face shields or goggles has been shown to prevent RSV infection in health care personnel (9,10). The need for these devices has been questioned because RSV infection was also prevented, in the absence of eye protection, if gloves were worn. Presumably, personnel were unlikely to rub their eyes with gloved hands (11).",

Experience with SARS coronavirus suggested that transmission may have occurred via small-particle aerosols generated during certain procedures such as intubation or bronchoscopy (12,13), and raised concern that a new more aggressive strain of influenza virus might also be transmitted by this route. Special tight-fitting masks with filters that remove particles down to 1 \u03bcm in diameter at a 95% efficacy (N95) are recommended for protection from small-particle aerosols. Where N95 masks are required, fit-testing is mandated. Fit-testing helps in choosing the appropriate brand and size of mask to provide a tight facial fit. However, it has been shown that fit-testing alone does not correlate with appropriate use of the fitted mask (14,15). To ensure a tight fit during use, the wearer must perform a fit-check every time the mask is applied. This is achieved by taking a forceful inspiration and expiration and checking for air leaks around the mask.",
