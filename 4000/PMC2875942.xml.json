Although the activity of individual viruses varied according to year studied, all viral infections were identified each year. Displayed graphically as cases per facility in each year (Figure 1), these data indicate the complex nature of viral respiratory disease in nursing homes. With the exception of two facilities in which 42% (1999) and 28% (2000) of residents tested were positive for hMPV and one facility with a 36% positive rate for influenza A during 1999, there did not appear to be predominance of a single pathogen within a nursing home.

Although this trial was not designed to examine the specific microbiological etiology of respiratory illnesses, the collection of blood at baseline and 1 year provided an opportunity for serological diagnosis of multiple viral infections over time. In addition to the well\u2010recognized pathogens influenza and RSV, infections due to hMPV, coronaviruses OC43 and 229E, and parainfluenza viruses were identified throughout the study period. Rather than large outbreaks of single pathogens, a veritable cornucopia of viruses circulated in individual nursing homes each year.",

In the current study, 24 and 19 residents were diagnosed with influenza A and B, respectively. None of the subjects infected with influenza A showed antibody rises to influenza B, and vice versa, suggesting that antibody rises were not vaccine induced. In addition, vaccine effect was less likely, because serum samples were obtained 7 to 9 months after immunization, when vaccine induced antibody has typically decreased to near baseline.\n22\n Another limitation of serology for viral diagnosis is the inability to identify rhinovirus. Rhinovirus is a ubiquitous pathogen that has been shown to cause outbreaks of respiratory disease in nursing homes, but serological diagnosis is not possible, because multiple serotypes exist.\n23\n Because rhinoviruses are a frequent cause of the common cold, it is not surprising that no association was found between URI and serological viral diagnosis.",
