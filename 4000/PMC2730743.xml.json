These episodes are distressing to patients and result in considerable utilization of health care resources and loss of work productivity and school attendance.

Further data from the NIS demonstrates that all age groups experienced hospitalization at similar rates, with a slight predominance of the 35\u201354\u2010year age range, representing 31.7% of admissions for asthma. However, the NIS shows that mortality increases dramatically with increasing age. Children and adolescents have the lowest mortality rate (0.02%) and the elderly have the highest mortality from asthma (1.9% for ages>75).

However, asthma prevalence is higher in post\u2010pubertal females than post\u2010pubertal males and this fact is a large part of the explanation for the higher numbers of adult females seeking care for acute asthma [9, 10]. The higher prevalence of asthma in adult females contrasts with the higher prevalence of asthma in male children [11]. This difference in gender predisposition for asthma in adulthood vs. childhood likely reflects the complicated effects of sex hormones in asthma pathogenesis. Evidence for a role of estrogen in asthma comes from observations of increased asthma exacerbations during menses [12], a higher incidence of adult\u2010onset asthma in women taking hormone replacement therapy [13], and from animal models [14].",

Data from longitudinal studies suggest that there may also be a link between obesity and risk of asthma exacerbations, including exacerbations severe enough to warrant treatment in the emergency department or in the hospital [24]. The mechanisms by which obesity could be a risk factor for asthma exacerbation are not known, but it is interesting that obesity is associated with the production of pro\u2010inflammatory factors and chemokines both in animal models and humans. These factors include eotaxin, an eosinophil chemoattractant, that is increased in the sputum during acute asthma [25, 26] as well as leptin, IL\u20106, and TNF\u2010\u03b1 [27].

Factors such as non\u2010white race, Medicaid insurance, other public or no insurance, and markers of asthma severity predicted risk of frequent visits. These data suggest that patients presenting with recurrent exacerbations are prone because of risks that relate to social factors, poor access to care, and inadequate chronic asthma control.

Notably, a significant percentage of asthmatics had multiple exacerbations requiring three or more bursts of oral corticosteroids per year ranging across all levels of severity: mild (5%), moderate (13%), and severe (54%). Near fatal events were also not infrequent among these groups: mild (4%), moderate (6%), and severe (23%). In addition, case\u2013control studies demonstrate that asthmatics with multiple exacerbations compared with those with single exacerbations are at increased risk for severe exacerbation, defined as initiation or escalation of systemic corticosteroids, despite more intensive maintenance anti\u2010inflammatory treatment [31]. Characteristic features of the exacerbation\u2010prone subjects include irreversible airflow limitation, chronic sinusitis, psychological dysfunction, and intolerance to non\u2010steroidal anti\u2010inflammatory medications [31, 32].",

The European Network for Understanding Mechanisms of Severe Asthma characterized subjects with severe asthma and found that the subgroup with prior near\u2010fatal asthma (NFA) differed from asthmatics of all severity groups with respect to reduced compliance with prescribed asthma medications and less corticosteroid use [33]. Interestingly, the NFA group was more similar to mild\u2010to\u2010moderate, rather than severe, asthmatics with regard to clinical and inflammatory parameters. Other studies have confirmed that asthmatics who suffer near fatal exacerbations are not distinguished by lung function, AHR, duration of asthma, gender, smoking status, ethnicity, and prevalence of atopy, but are distinguished by medication non\u2010compliance, poor asthma control, and less corticosteroid use [34, 35, 36]. Asthmatics who experience near fatal exacerbations are an important subgroup of asthma, because better interventions for education, compliance, and use of inhaled corticosteroids might reduce the incidence of recurrent near fatal events. In addition, there is an association between admission to an intensive care unit and skin test sensitivity to fungal allergens, including Alternaria and Cladosporium [37]. The results of this cross\u2010sectional study need to be replicated in further studies, but it is possible that environmental intervention to reduce exposure to moulds could help reduce the frequency of asthma exacerbations in certain asthmatics.",

            "text": "Asthma is associated with accelerated loss of lung function, although it is likely that a subgroup of asthmatics drives this association [38, 39], and a minority of asthmatics (27% in one cohort study of difficult\u2010to\u2010control asthmatics [40]) develops some degree of irreversible airflow obstruction. This subgroup of asthmatic patients with chronic airflow obstruction is at increased risk for acute asthma exacerbation, because reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) has been shown to be an important risk factor for multiple asthma exacerbations requiring either hospital care or systemic corticosteroids [31, 41]. The relationship between FEV1 and risk of asthma exacerbation could be because exacerbations cause or promote long\u2010term reductions in lung function or alternatively, the relationship may be a result of specific types of airway inflammation or specific host factors, such as smoking, that increase the risk of both exacerbation and lung function decline. A recent retrospective cohort study provided evidence in favour of exacerbation as an independent risk for accelerated loss of lung function. Specifically, the effect of severe exacerbations, defined by hospitalization or a decrease in FEV120% and 500 mL, on the progression of airway obstruction was evaluated in 93 non\u2010smoking asthmatics with moderate\u2010to\u2010severe disease before treatment with inhaled corticosteroids [42]. Those asthmatics who experienced at least one severe exacerbation had accelerated loss of lung function compared with those who did not have any exacerbations. The relationship between exacerbations and accelerated loss of lung function was independent of airflow obstruction at baseline. Indeed, one severe exacerbation per year was associated with a 30.2 mL greater annual decline in FEV1 and more severe airflow obstruction after 11 years of follow\u2010up. A possible explanation is that the multiple inflammatory pathways activated during acute exacerbation, including elevation of matrix metalloproteinases [43], may have long\u2010term consequences for airway remodelling [44] that result in airway narrowing. In this way asthma exacerbation may become self\u2010perpetuating with one exacerbation causing changes in lung function that promote a subsequent exacerbation. This cycle may help explain the \u2018exacerbation\u2010prone\u2019 phenotype (Fig. 1).",

Asthma is a heterogeneous disease and it is likely that these different extrinsic precipitants for exacerbation are more or less important in different individuals. While the environmental causes of asthma exacerbation are heterogeneous, common upper respiratory tract viruses, especially rhinoviruses, are the most common and important causes of exacerbation in both children and adults [49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54]. With the development of PCR techniques for viral detection, multiple community\u2010based studies have consistently shown this. For example, in a study of children experiencing asthma exacerbations with decreased peak flow rates, viruses were detected in airway secretions in 80% to 85% of the cases, with rhinoviruses being the most commonly detected virus [54]. Other studies report rates of viral infection in acute asthma of between 55% and 78%, and rhinoviruses and coronaviruses are the most common culprits [52, 53]. Other viral causes include influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae [49, 53, 55, 56]. Newer virus detections methods such as DNA microarray\u2010based viral detection methods show that multiple serotypes of rhinoviruses are detectable in airway secretions during respiratory infection in asthmatics [57].",

Allergic rhinitis subjects infected with rhinovirus, and then challenged with allergen during their colds had greater histamine release (both during and 48 h after allergen challenge), as well as greater recruitment of eosinophils to the airway 48 h afterwards [60]. These effects persisted up to 1 month following the infection and were not observed in non\u2010atopic subjects.

Rhinovirus affects both the upper and lower airways, and primarily infects the epithelial cells lining the airway in close contact with the environment [61]. Infection of airway epithelial cells produces a variety of pro\u2010inflammatory mediators including IL\u20101, IL\u20106, IL\u20108, IFN\u2010inducible protein of 10 kDa (IP\u201010), regulated on activation normal T cell expressed (RANTES), granulocyte macrophage\u2010colony stimulating factor, and eotaxin (Fig. 4) [62, 63, 64]. These cytokines and chemokines recruit inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils to the airway. Neutrophils are the predominant inflammatory cell detected in airway secretions during acute exacerbation [65, 66, 67]. Subjects who report having a respiratory tract infection as the trigger for their exacerbation have significantly higher percentages of neutrophils in their sputum [65]. This is probably caused by increases in epithelial IL\u20108 production, which is a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils. Although corticosteroids can reduce epithelial cell expression of several chemokines, such as RANTES and IL\u20108, they may not be effective at inhibiting the other virus\u2010induced pathways of inflammation, and their effectiveness at preventing virus\u2010induced exacerbation remains controversial [68].",

Double\u2010stranded RNA, a byproduct of viral replication then binds to Toll\u2010like receptor and activates intracellular signalling through the nuclear factor\u2010\u03ba B pathway, resulting in elaboration of the type I interferons (IFN\u2010\u03b1 and IFN\u2010\u03b2) [70]. The IFNs activate a programme of anti\u2010viral genes that act to limit viral replication and viral spread to neighbouring epithelial cells [71].",

For example, during experimental infection of asthmatic subjects with rhinovirus, the ratio of sputum IFN\u2010\u03b3 (Th1) to IL\u20104 (Th2) correlated inversely with peak cold symptoms and time to virus clearance [75].

In addition, smoking was found to be the most powerful independent modifiable risk factor for multiple exacerbations requiring hospital care in a prospective HMO\u2010based study [41]. Another important modifiable risk factor in this study was exposure and allergic sensitivity to cat or dog, further underscoring the interaction between allergic and viral causes. Cigarette smoke has several effects on the airway that could promote asthma exacerbations. For example, cigarette smoking is associated with airway neutrophilia [77] and with changes in airway epithelial mucin stores that could affect viral clearance from the airway [78] (Fig. 4). Other important extrinsic susceptibility factors include co\u2010morbidities such as chronic rhinosinusitis, history of pneumonia, obesity, and GERD, and intolerance to NSAIDs [24, 31, 79].

Specifically, experimental models which infect primary bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatic and healthy subjects with rhinovirus have shown that epithelial cells from healthy subjects are quite resistant to infection but that cells from asthmatics have enhanced viral replication and cell lysis [81]. In addition, apoptosis, rather than direct lysis, of an infected cell was important for controlling viral production and release of inflammatory mediators, and early induction of apoptosis was dramatically impaired in asthmatic vs. healthy cells [81]. Furthermore, asthmatic cells were deficient in the production of IFN\u2010\u03b2, an early important anti\u2010viral cytokine, and exogenous IFN\u2010\u03b2 restored the apoptosis defect in asthmatic cells and inhibited viral replication, suggesting that anti\u2010viral pathways are intact in asthmatic cells but there is a deficiency in activating key anti\u2010viral cytokines (Fig. 4). Similar results were also discovered for IFN\u2010\u03bb, a novel type III IFN with similar anti\u2010viral properties [82]. This deficiency was observed whether or not asthmatics were taking inhaled corticosteroids. These defects in asthmatic epithelial cells also extended to macrophages from asthmatics, which were also deficient in IFN production. These data are important because a deficient anti\u2010viral response to rhinovirus infection could enhance viral replication, cell damage, and production of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines resulting in exacerbation of asthma. At this time the mechanism of this suboptimal anti\u2010viral response is poorly understood and specific interventions to remedy it are not available.",

Corticosteroids have been shown to enhance innate immunity and epithelial host defense while reducing pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine production, which may explain their role in reducing asthma exacerbation [68]. Furthermore, rhinovirus infection of epithelial cells leads to up\u2010regulation of its own viral receptor, ICAM\u20101, whereas, corticosteroids can inhibit the induction of ICAM\u20101 by rhinovirus [87]. Corticosteroids also reduce AHR, a strategy that might lead to better control of exacerbations [88]. Despite their clear benefits, asthmatics at risk for exacerbation are generally under\u2010treated with inhaled corticosteroids. An emphasis on asthma exacerbations as a specific outcome in asthma therapy in the recent guidelines of the NIH/NHLBI National Asthma Education and Prevention Program should help to educate providers about the need for corticosteroid use in patients with fewer daily symptoms, but recurrent exacerbations [6]. Recognizing that exacerbations occur even in some asthmatics using chronic systemic corticosteroids highlights the need to continue working towards more effective, mechanism\u2010targeted therapies.",

Levels of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) correlate with numbers of sputum eosinophils and can be measured less invasively [100].
