            "text": "Hepatitis is an inflammatory disease induced by various causes, such as bacteria and viruses. The viral persistence in liver is associated with a chronic hepatitis leading to cirrhosis, hepatic carcinoma and death [1\u20133]. The role of natural killer (NK) cells is to provide a first line of defence against bacteria, tumour cells and virus-infected cells through the exertion, without priming, of a cytotoxic function as well as a production of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 [4,5]. However, the fulminance of the hepatitis cannot result from a deficiency in antiviral adaptative immune responses following a decrease in T and B lymphoid cells. The acute hepatitis suggests a virus-mediated deficiency in innate immunity mechanisms. However, it was reported recently that the hepatitis C envelope protein can bind to natural killer (NK) cells and impair their cytotoxic properties and IFN-\u03b3 production, thus altering the host's natural defences and innate immunity against viral hepatitis [6,7]. The liver contains a population of NK cells and a unique population of T cells with an intermediate level of \u03b1\u03b2-T cell receptor (TCR) cells expressing the NK1\u00b71 marker (NK-T cells) [8,9]. The level of NK cell subsets in the liver during the first days of the infection depends on both their recruitment from peripheral lymphoid organs and the efficiency of NK cell production by the bone marrow. NK cells are large granular lymphocytes derived from bone-marrow (BM) progenitor cells which require an intact microenvironment as well as interleukin (IL)-15 production for their complete maturation into lytic cells [10,11]. However, the role of intrahepatic NK cells in the viral hepatitis process is not elucidated.",

The MHV3 virus induces acute and/or chronic hepatitis associated with viral persistence and immunodeficiency [12,13]. The sensitivity of mice to MHV3 infection varies according to the strain, age and immune status of the animal. The development of a fulminant hepatitis in susceptible C57BL/6 mice which leads to the death of the animal within 3\u20135 days post-infection (p.i.) is accompanied by a loss of T lymphocytes in spleen and thymus as well as a decrease of splenic and myeloid B lymphocytes [14\u201316]. We have previously generated an attenuated viral variant, the YAC-MHV3, which induces a subclinical hepatitis in susceptible C57BL/6 mice without inducing immune disorders in the lymphoid organs, including bone marrow, and in T and B lymphocytes [15\u201318].",

            "text": "Controversial results on the protective role of NK cells in MHV infections were reported 20 years ago. At that time, it was observed that NK cell activity increased in peritoneal exudates from MHV3-infected C57BL/6 mice suggesting that NK cells did not play an important role in the defence of mice against MHV3 infection [21,22]. Stohlman et al. [22] have observed no IFN-\u03b3 production in spite of increase of NK cell cytotoxicity favouring viral replication as it was demonstrated that IFN-\u03b3 is involved in the protection against MHV3-induced hepatitis [23]. In addition, the NK depletion increased both inflammatory foci and virus titres in the liver of MHV-infected mice [24]. On the other hand, the natural resistance of A/J mice to the fulminant hepatitis induced by MHV3 has been shown to depend on a bone marrow subpopulation showing features similar to those of NK cells [25]. This observation suggests that the integrity of the bone marrow may play a crucial role in the resistance against the acute phase of hepatitis via the production of NK cells. Taken together, these observations suggest that NK cell disorders may be involved in pathogenic L2-MHV-infected mice. Then, the maturation process of NK cells in bone marrow would be impaired in pathogenic L2-MHV3-infected mice, as demonstrated previously for myeloid pre-B and B lymphocytes [15], leading to a decreased production of cytotoxic NK cells and lower recruitment of NK cells in liver.",

The number of mononuclear cells isolated from the livers was higher in L2-MHV3-infected mice (5\u00b723 \u00b1 1\u00b75 \u00d7 106 cells/liver) (P < 0\u00b7001) than in YAC-MHV3- or mock-infected mice (1\u00b75 \u00b1 1\u00b72 \u00d7 106 and 1\u00b72 \u00b1 0\u00b72 \u00d7 106 cells/liver, respectively).

However, the recruitment of NK1\u00b71+ cells in L2-MHV3-infected mice remained lower than that of other lymphoid cell subsets, indicating that the recruitment of NK1\u00b71+ cells in the infected liver could explain partially the loss of splenic NK1\u00b71+ cells in L2-MHV3-infected mice. These results are in agreement with previous studies demonstrating that, in contrast to other murine viral infections, only the first wave of recruited large granular cells, including NK1\u00b71+ and CTL cells, occurs in the liver or peritoneal exudates of MHV-infected mice in the first 3 days p.i. [27,28]. The increase of absolute numbers in intrahepatic NK1\u00b71+TCR\u2212 cells in L2-MHV3-infected mice, however, remained very low compared to the decrease in splenic NK1\u00b71+ cells, suggesting either that most NK1\u00b71+ cells are recruited in other target organs or that production of new NK1\u00b71+ cells by the bone marrow is impaired.",

            "text": "The fact that splenic NK1\u00b71+ cells are normally mature and do not undergo mitosis [29] suggests that a depletion of these cells might be the result of a decrease in bone marrow production. This hypothesis was verified through the analysis of the NK1\u00b71+ subpopulation in the bone marrow of L2-MHV3-infected mice. We have showed that both normal and larger lymphoid cells decreased in virus-infected mice. The phenotyping of the cells indicated that normal NK1\u00b71+ decreased as soon as 24 h p.i. while large B cells decreased later, indicating that myeloid NK1\u00b71+ cells are more sensitive to virus-mediated depletion than B lineage cells. We can expect that the NK1\u00b71+ cell decrease in the first 24 h p.i. is due to a recruitment in liver. However, normal and larger NK1\u00b71+ cells decreased strongly at 72 h p.i. in bone marrow from L2-MHV3-infected mice only, suggesting a virus-induced decrease of these cells rather than a low recruitment in liver. The in vitro L2-MHV3 infection of rIL-15 stimulated cells, permitting the increase of the NK1\u00b71+ cells rather than B cells [11,30], revealed that the depletion of NK1\u00b71+ cells resulted from virus-induced cytopathic effects, viral replication and apoptosis occurring in syncytia, as demonstrated by the production of infectious particles and TUNEL assay. The permissivity of NK cells to L2-MHV3 infection involves the expression of the MHV receptor on the cell surface. CEACAM isoform 1 of the biliary glycoprotein (Bgp) molecules expressed on the cell surface are known to act as MHV receptor [31,32]. These molecules are present in many cell types, including hepatocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells, thymic epithelial cells and B lymphocytes [32,33]. There are no reports concerning the expression of CEACAM-1 on mouse NK1\u00b71+ cells, but a similar protein was detected recently on human T cells and activated NK1\u00b71+ cells [34], suggesting that viral permissivity of NK1\u00b71+ cells to MHV3 virus may be related to the presence of a specific MHV-receptor. Preliminary results from in vitro L2-MHV3 infections of NK1\u00b71+ cells cultured in the presence of myeloid dendritic cells revealed that the NK1\u00b71+ cells expressed intracellular viral proteins, thus reinforcing the hypothesis of viral replication in NK cells. In the present study, B220+ cells decreased slightly in L2-MHV3-infected myeloid cells, just as we had observed previously in infected myeloid B lineage cells [15].",

However, infectious particle production was similar to that seen in L2-MHV3-infected cells. In spite of a similar production of infectious viruses in the first 24 h p.i., the apparent discrepancy in the sensitivity of NK1\u00b71+ cells to the attenuated YAC-MHV3 can be explained by the fact that a lower number of IL-15-stimulated myeloid cells can be efficiently infected by the YAC-MHV3 variant.

            "text": "The fact that the death of virus-infected NK1\u00b71+ cells involves syncytia formation and apoptosis suggests that MHV3 replication induces an apoptotic process. It was demonstrated recently that MHV3 can induce apoptosis in macrophages from 8 h to 12 h p.i. [36,37]. Interestingly, viral pathogenicity seems directly correlated with syncytia formation rather than apoptosis, as lower numbers of NK cell syncytia were observed in YAC-MHV3-infected cells even though in vitro apoptosis levels were similar to those induced by the pathogenic L2-MHV3 strain. The new E protein of MHV viruses has been related to the apoptotic process in virus-infected cells [38].",

            "text": "Many previous studies have demonstrated that MHV3 is the most virulent serotype of the MHV viruses because it induces a fulminant hepatitis leading to the death of the animal within 3 days p.i. [12,14]. We have observed previously that splenic T and B cell subsets decreased in L2-MHV3-infected mice [15,16,39]. However, the fulminant hepatitis observed in C57BL/6 cannot be explained by T and B cell depletions alone. Budowski et al. [24] have shown a higher replication of MHV and a more extensive hepatitis along with higher numbers of inflammatory foci in the livers of asialo-GM1-depleted mice, hinting at the important role of NK1\u00b71+ cells in limiting the spread of the viral replication during the first days of the infection. Rather, Stohlman et al. [22] have demonstrated that, in C57BL/6 mice, MHV-JHM induced an increase of natural cytotoxicity against YAC-1 target cells without detectable IFN-\u03b3 production, such as seen in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-infected mice. In addition, the NK1\u00b71+ cell response was variable among mice, raising the possibility of MHV-mediated disorders in NK1\u00b71+ functions. Our results are in agreement with these observations, but also suggest that higher cytotoxicity of intrahepatic NK cells from L2-MHV3-infected mice reflects extensive histopathological lesions leading to a fulminant hepatitis and a rapid death rather than an efficient antiviral natural response.",
