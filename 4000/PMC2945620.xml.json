The localization of viral RNA replication on membrane surfaces is believed to provide several advantages for the virus: it locally concentrates viral proteins that may initially be present in low concentration, ensures proper orientation of the constituents of multi\u2010component replication complexes and hides replicating viral RNA templates and products from cellular innate immunity detection and protection mechanisms (Salonen et al., 2005). The subversion of cellular membranes to support virus replication required that these viruses evolve mechanisms to reorganize the normal membrane metabolic pathways.",

            "text": "We recently reported that infection of cells with poliovirus results in a hijacking of the cellular guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) GBF1 to sites of viral RNA replication, where it functions in the viral replication complexes (2007, 2008). GBF1 is one of three mammalian high\u2010molecular\u2010weight GEFs responsible for activating the ADP\u2010ribosylation factor (Arf) GTPases in the Golgi and endosomal membrane systems (Casanova, 2007; Bui et al., 2009). These three GEFs have been shown to activate Arf1 and function in Arf1\u2010regulated processes, but as they may also use Arf4 and Arf5 as substrates (Claude et al., 1999; Volpicelli\u2010Daley et al., 2005), we will refer to them as GEFs for Arf rather than a specific Arf isoform. Arf1 cycles between an inactive, cytoplasmic GDP\u2010bound form and an activated, GTP\u2010bound membrane\u2010targeted form. Membrane\u2010bound Arf1 induces the formation of coated membrane vesicles on cellular organelles; it also regulates cytoskeletal functions and recruits effector proteins to membranes (D'Souza\u2010Schorey and Chavrier, 2006; Gillingham and Munro, 2007). The Arf activation/nucleotide exchange activity of GBF1 is catalysed by the Sec7 domain, shared by all Arf GEFs. Apart from the catalytic Sec7 domain, this large protein of about 210 kDa contains five other conserved domains (Mouratou et al., 2005) (see Fig. 4A) whose functions are poorly understood. The N\u2010terminal DCB and HUS domains have been implicated in inter\u2010 and intra\u2010molecular interactions and thus are believed to participate in regulation of Arf activation by GBF1 (Ramaen et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Poliovirus belongs to the family Picornaviridae of positive strand RNA viruses. Picornaviruses are small non\u2010enveloped viruses whose genome RNA is directly translated after infection into a polyprotein that is processed by viral proteinases into intermediate and final cleavage products, all of which function in the virus life cycle (Fig. 3A). Production of viral non\u2010structural proteins is sufficient to induce the formation of characteristic clusters of membranous vesicles of \u223c200\u2013400 nm diameter, a hallmark morphologic feature of polio\u2010infected cells (Teterina et al., 1997; Suhy et al., 2000). We have demonstrated that GBF1 inactivation is the cause of poliovirus sensitivity to BFA and that expression of a BFA\u2010resistant mutant of GBF1 restores virus replication in the presence of the inhibitor. Non\u2010structural protein 3A of polio and the related Coxsackie B3 virus directly binds the N\u2010terminal portion of GBF1 (2006a, 2006b), thus providing a mechanism for recruitment of this cellular protein into viral replication complexes. GBF1 was shown to be important for viral RNA replication per se, not for remodelling of cellular membranes into the vesicle\u2010like membranous scaffold as might have been predicted based on the established role of GBF1 in COPI\u2010dependent vesicle budding (2007, 2008).",

We found that the GBF1 binding partner p115 is specifically degraded in infected cells and that depletion of the N\u2010terminal GBF1 binding partner Rab1b does not affect virus replication. The Sec7 domain's catalytic activity is not necessary to support virus replication. We provide evidence that polio replication can occur without activation of Arf by GBF1 and that the absence of activated Arf does not disrupt the association of polio proteins with cellular membranes. The entire C\u2010terminal portion of GBF1 is dispensable for virus replication, and essential functions are provided solely by the N\u2010terminal region containing the DCB and HUS domains of the protein.",

            "text": "Previously we showed that the cellular Arf\u2010GEF GBF1 is an essential host factor for poliovirus replication. We also demonstrated that poliovirus proteins synthesized in the presence of BFA, a potent inhibitor of GBF1\u2010dependent activation of Arf, still induced remodelling of cellular membranes indistinguishable from that observed during productive infection. However those membranous structures did not support polio RNA replication even when the BFA block was relieved (Belov et al., 2008). We considered whether the lack of GBF1 activity in the presence of BFA and therefore the absence of activated Arf on membranes affected the overall architecture of the viral replication complex. We examined the association of poliovirus proteins with cellular membranes and their sensitivity to proteinase K digestion. Poliovirus proteins were expressed in HeLa cells by infecting the cells with vaccinia virus producing T7 RNA polymerase and then transfecting them with a plasmid bearing poliovirus cDNA under control of the T7 promotor. BFA (4 ug ml\u22121) or its solvent, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), was added at the time of transfection. This approach allows robust synthesis of polio proteins even in the presence of BFA because this inhibitor does not affect vaccinia virus replication or T7 RNA polymerase activity. At 4.5 h post transfection the cells were treated with digitonin to permeabilize the plasma membrane, and the cells were exposed to proteinase K. Proteins were collected, resolved by SDS\u2010PAGE and visualized in immunoblots with different anti\u2010polio protein antibodies. Samples not treated with BFA showed slightly greater levels of viral protein synthesis, because of additional mRNA produced from viral RNA replication (as opposed to T7 RNA polymerase transcription) and/or to reduced transfection efficiency in cells treated with BFA (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 9 and 10). After digitonin treatment, almost all of the viral membrane binding proteins 2C, 2BC and 3A remained in the cells, as expected, because of their association with intracellular membranous structures (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 9, 10 and 5, 6, upper and middle panels respectively). Proteins 3D and 3CD, however, which lack intrinsic membrane binding domains, were only partially recovered from the permeabilized cells (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 9, 10 and 5, 6, lower panel). When the digitonin\u2010permeabilized cells were treated with proteinase K, poliovirus proteins demonstrated various degrees of resistance to proteolysis with the most resistant 3A (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1, 2 and 5, 6, middle panel) and the least protected 3CD and 2BC (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1, 2 and 5, 6, lower and upper panels respectively). Importantly, the amount of polio proteins retained in cells after permeabilization and the level of their accessibility to proteinase K did not dramatically differ in BFA\u2010treated and non\u2010treated cells (Fig. 1). Thus the failure to activate Arf did not significantly alter the extent of binding to membranes or the overall protection from proteinase K degradation of these viral proteins.",

The cellular functions of GBF1 are regulated by and depend upon its interactions with other proteins. Therefore, we investigated the fates of known cellular GBF1 binding partners during infection to determine whether these interactions are important for polio replication. The membrane tethering factor p115 was shown to bind to the C\u2010terminal proline\u2010rich sequence of GBF1 (Garcia\u2010Mata and Sztul, 2003). When we analysed endogenous p115 by Western blot of cytoplasmic extracts from poliovirus\u2010infected HeLa cells at different times after infection, we found that p115 underwent rapid and specific degradation (Fig. 2A, left upper panel). By 6 h post infection, only a small amount of the intact p115 remained. The disappearance of p115 was accompanied by the appearance of a major immunoreactive band(s) of \u223c95 kDa. The course of virus infection was monitored by blotting the same membranes with antibodies against the viral protein 2C, a well\u2010characterized viral replication protein (Fig. 2A, lower panels).",

To test whether the observed degradation of p115 in poliovirus\u2010infected cells was caspase\u2010dependent, we infected HeLa cells in the presence of the broad spectrum, cell\u2010permeable caspase inhibitor z\u2010VAD\u2010fmk.

All of them contribute to the maturation of viral polypeptides, and they also cleave some specific cellular targets and induce modification of cellular metabolism favourable for the development of infection (Clark et al., 1993; Roehl et al., 1997; Yalamanchili et al., 1997; Ventoso et al., 1998; Kuyumcu\u2010Martinez et al., 2002; Belov et al., 2004; Kundu et al., 2005).

These results prompted us to further compare the functions of GBF1 necessary for supporting normal cellular metabolism from those needed for virus replication. Bioinformatics analysis has identified six conserved domains in the GBF1 sequence (Mouratou et al., 2005), including the Sec7 domain, which is catalytically responsible for guanine nucleotide exchange and Arf activation. Figure 4A shows the domain assembly in the full\u2010length protein, and a series of truncated GBF1 constructs based on a YFP\u2010GBF1 expression vector, that were constructed for function analysis. This full\u2010length GBF1 fusion has been shown to be competent for all known GBF1\u2010related functions and has been extensively used in studies of both infected and uninfected cells (Niu et al., 2005; 2006a, 2006b; 2007, 2008; Deng et al., 2009). In addition, GBF1 constructs used in this experiment had the A795E BFA\u2010resistant mutation in the Sec7 domain described previously (Belov et al., 2008). We first tested these constructs for their abilities to support cellular protein secretion and to maintain cell viability in the presence of BFA. Cell secretion was measured by monitoring the activity of secreted Gaussia luciferase, which has a cellular secretion signal sequence (Tannous et al., 2005), in the medium after incubation of cells for 5 h in the presence of 1 \u00b5g ml\u22121 BFA. Expression of the different protein constructs was monitored by SDS\u2010PAGE. Figure 4B shows that secretion of the reporter protein was efficiently rescued by expression of the full\u2010length GBF1 fusion protein, but not by any of the truncated mutants even though they were often expressed at higher levels than the full\u2010length protein, especially the shortest GBF1(1\u2013710) construct (Fig. 4B, right panels). The full\u2010length fusion protein frequently resolved into a doublet band (see Fig. 4B, upper gel). This may reflect post\u2010translational modification(s) of the protein, e.g. phosphorylation of GBF1 has been reported previously (Miyamoto et al., 2008).",

Under these conditions endogenous GBF1 is inhibited and viral RNA replication requires an ectopically expressed GBF1 species. Expression of any of the GBF1 constructs had no effect on viral RNA replication in the absence of BFA (Fig. 6, left panels). Expression of GBF1 species was confirmed by Western blot (not shown). In agreement with our previous data, the small deletion of only 37 amino acids from the N\u2010terminus of GBF1 completely abrogated its replication rescue capacity (Fig. 6, upper right panel). However, deletion of the C\u2010terminal domains HDS2 and HDS3 did not interfere with the ability of GBF1 to support polio replication (Fig. 6, middle right panel). Replication rescue dropped sharply with further deletion of the HDS1 domain (Fig. 6, lower right panel). Thus, the N\u2010terminal portion of GBF1 contains domains essential for function in both cellular and viral metabolic pathways. This region of GBF1 was identified previously to be necessary and sufficient for binding of the 3A protein of Coxsackie B3 virus, a close relative of polio (2006b, 2007). However, in contrast to the essential role of the C\u2010terminal portion of GBF1 in uninfected cells, the C\u2010terminal HDS2 and HDS3 domains of GBF1 are completely dispensable for the replication of poliovirus. These results restrict the functional contribution of GBF1 for poliovirus replication to the region between the N\u2010terminus and somewhere within the HDS1 domain. It is not clear whether the HDS1 domain per se might be required for virus replication, or whether it serves to maintain the conformation or stability of the truncated protein.",

The reduced replication rescue by the GBF1(1\u2013894) construct described above could indicate interference with Sec7 domain activity in the absence of any downstream sequences. To determine whether Sec7 activity contributed to the observed level of rescue by GBF1(1\u2013894), we introduced the dominant\u2010negative mutation E794K into this construct. Surprisingly, we did not observe any inhibition of the rescue capacity of GBF1(1\u2013894) E794K compared with the construct GBF1(1\u2013894) with the unmodified Sec7 sequence (Fig. 7, upper panels), suggesting that the rescue ability of this construct did not depend on the ability to induce Arf activation. To confirm that Sec7 activity was not required for at least some level of polio replication, we expressed only the N\u2010terminal sequences of GBF1, including the DCB and HUS domains but excluding the Sec7 domain. Again we saw clearly detectable levels of polio replication rescue from BFA inhibition in HeLa cells expressing this construct (Fig. 7, middle panels). To eliminate any potential interference by the YFP fused to the N\u2010terminus of GBF1 used in these experiments (or any unlikely contribution of YFP to the rescue of polio replication), we generated a new set of GBF1 expression vectors that produce authentic GBF1 N\u2010termini. As expected, the GBF1(1\u2013710) fragment without YFP fusion was inactive for rescue of cells from BFA cytotoxicity or for rescue of secretion of Gaussia luciferase (not shown). However this GBF1(1\u2013710) fragment demonstrated a significant level of polio replication rescue (Fig. 7, lower panels). Expression of all GBF1 constructs was verified with Western blots (not shown). Thus, the essential functions for polio replication can be provided by the N\u2010terminus of GBF1, while the Sec7 domain is not necessary.",

The results reported above, however, suggested that functions of GBF1 essential for polio replication could be separated from its Arf\u2010activating capacity. It was unclear whether the accumulation of activated Arf GTPase that we observed at viral replication sites was a by\u2010product of GBF1 recruitment, perhaps contributing to virus growth in an unknown way. Crotty et al. have isolated a mutant of poliovirus (DM) that is resistant to inhibition by BFA as a result of two point mutations in the 2C and 3A proteins (Crotty et al., 2004). Robust growth of this virus in the presence of BFA suggested that it could replicate without Arf activation. We examined the state of Arf activation during replication of this BFA\u2010resistant mutant by using a GGA pull\u2010down assay (Kawamoto et al., 2002) that detects Arf only in its activated, GTP\u2010bound form. Figure 8A shows that in the absence of BFA, there was a steady increase in Arf\u2010GTP accumulation during the course of infection, as seen previously during wild\u2010type poliovirus infection (Belov et al., 2007). During virus replication in the presence of BFA, however, no Arf activation was detected. Virus replication was slightly delayed compared with infection in the absence of the inhibitor, as shown by measuring the production of proteins containing poliovirus 2C sequences (Fig. 8A, bottom immunoblot). This experiment demonstrates that replication of poliovirus can occur without Arf activation. The ability of the DM mutant to grow in the presence of BFA without Arf activation raised the question of whether this virus still requires GBF1 sequences for replication. We knocked down expression of GBF1 with siRNA treatment. In the absence of BFA, replication of the DM mutant in GBF1 siRNA\u2010treated cells was inhibited. The level of inhibition showed some variability, from almost complete to about 70%, as observed in this experiment (Fig. 8B, left panel). This variability may reflect different levels of cytotoxicity of GBF1 depletion, reported previously (Belov et al., 2008; Citterio et al., 2008). In spite of the rather modest inhibition of replication of the DM mutant in the absence of BFA in this experiment, GBF1\u2010deficient cells were almost completely non\u2010permissive for the DM mutant in the presence of the inhibitor while the control cells supported a high level of replication of this replicon (Fig. 8B, right panel). Thus, GBF1 is mandatory for polio replication, but its GEF activity is dispensable.",

            "text": "Viruses inevitably require cellular machinery to replicate their genomes and produce progeny virions. Previously we identified the cellular protein GBF1 as a host component essential for replication of poliovirus and demonstrated that this protein accumulates on membranes associated with viral replication complexes (2007, 2008). In this study we investigated the GBF1 contribution to viral RNA replication in comparison with its functions required for cellular metabolism. In uninfected cells GBF1 is located at the ER\u2010Golgi interface; it is responsible for activation of Arf GTPases necessary for formation of COPI\u2010coated membranous vesicles returning membrane lipids and proteins from the Golgi to ER (Casanova, 2007). The large size and multidomain assembly of the GBF1 protein suggests that this protein might engage in numerous interactions with other cellular proteins. All or some subset of those interactions may participate in virus replication when GBF1 is recruited to the sites of viral replication complexes in infected cells. Of the cellular partners known to interact with GBF1, the membrane tethering protein p115 interacts with the C\u2010terminus (Garcia\u2010Mata and Sztul, 2003), while the small cellular GTPase Rab1b was shown to bind to the N\u2010terminal segment (Monetta et al., 2007). Rab1b and p115 also interact with each other, and this interaction is important for recruitment of a specific set of SNARE proteins that determine proper docking and fusion of COPII\u2010coated vesicles transferring material from the ER to Golgi (Allan et al., 2000). Thus, Rab1b and p115 seem to modulate GBF1 function in the secretory pathway, and interactions among these three proteins coordinate and regulate COPII\u2010dependent anterograde and COPI\u2010dependent retrograde transport (Alvarez et al., 2003; Monetta et al., 2007). It was suggested that COPII\u2010 and COPI\u2010dependent vesicular transport mechanisms may be hijacked by picornaviruses and participate in viral replication. Rust et al. demonstrated that poliovirus non\u2010structural proteins are found in infected cells in COPII\u2010positive structures on the ER, interpreted to be ER exit sites (Rust et al., 2001). COPI coat proteins were shown to colocalize with viral replication complexes in cells infected with a related picornavirus, echovirus 11 (Gazina et al., 2002). COPI components were also identified in a total genome screen for the factors required for the replication of a picornavirus\u2010related Drosophila C virus (Cherry et al., 2006). Our data, however, indicate that neither COPII\u2010 nor COPI\u2010mediated pathways of normal cellular membrane traffic are subverted in toto for virus replication. We found that replication does not depend on Rab1b or p115 and that the latter protein is degraded in infected cells, while both of these proteins are important for the normal functioning of COPI\u2010 and COPII\u2010dependent pathways. Investigation of the ability of truncated GBF1 species to support polio replication and cellular functions revealed that the truncated GBF1(1\u20131060) construct, lacking the entire C\u2010terminal HDS2 and HDS3 domains, was indistinguishable from the full\u2010length construct in supporting virus replication, although it failed to function for cell secretion and viability. The next upstream domain of GBF1, HDS1, seems to significantly contribute to the level of replication, either because of its specific sequence determinants or because it stabilizes structural and conformational properties of the more N\u2010terminal portion of GBF1. The finding that the C\u2010terminal domains of GBF1 are dispensable for virus replication is consistent with the observation that p115, which interacts with this region of GBF1, is degraded in polio\u2010infected cells and thus the intact p115 protein or its degradation fragments are not required for replication. However, it is possible that degradation of p115 may be important for virus growth in the animal host as it can contribute to the shutdown of the secretory pathway believed to facilitate evasion of immune protection mechanisms utilized by poliovirus (Deitz et al., 2000; Dodd et al., 2001; Neznanov et al., 2001). These data provide strong support for the idea that poliovirus does not hijack a complete cellular membrane traffic pathway (COPI\u2010 or COPII\u2010dependent) in toto. Rather, it seems that poliovirus combines individual steps representing portions of normally distinct biochemical pathways for building its replication machinery, resulting in severe disturbance and rearrangement of pre\u2010existing cellular membrane trafficking reactions.",

This activity is carried out by the Sec7 domain of GBF1, a centrally located region that makes up only 10% of this large 200 kDa protein. The drug BFA inhibits GBF1 function by binding to a normally transient complex between the Sec7 domain of the GEF and its substrate, Arf\u2010GDP, thus preventing nucleotide exchange (Mossessova et al., 2003; Renault et al., 2003). When cells are treated with BFA, GBF1 accumulates on membranes up to four times its normal level (Niu et al., 2005). Hence, although a major effect of BFA is blocking Arf activation, BFA also interferes with other GBF1 functions by trapping it in an inactive complex with Arf1\u2010GDP and inhibiting the dynamic cycle of binding and release of GBF1 from membranes.",

            "text": "One interpretation of the inhibition of polio replication by BFA is that Arf activation is important for virus growth; and indeed it was shown that the levels of activated Arf increased in infected cells during the replication cycle (Belov et al., 2007). In addition, previous experiments showed that GBF1 harbouring an inactivating mutation in Sec7 was unable to rescue polio replication in the presence of BFA and thus supported the notion that Arf activation by GBF1 played an important role in polio replication (2007, 2008). Moreover, two BFA\u2010resistant variants of GBF1 that have point mutations in their Arf\u2010activating Sec7 domains, A795E and M832L, efficiently rescue both poliovirus and Coxsackie virus B3 replication from BFA inhibition (Belov et al., 2008; Lanke et al., 2009). However, in this study, we have tested a series of truncated mutants of GBF1 for their abilities to support polio replication in the presence of BFA, and were surprised to see that the Sec7 domain necessary for Arf activation was dispensable for viral replication. Expression of the GBF1 fragment containing just two N\u2010terminal domains DCB and HUS was sufficient to rescue a significant (albeit not complete) level of replication of the wild\u2010type polio replicon in the presence of BFA. The separation of the replication\u2010supporting function of GBF1 from its Arf activation function is consistent with our previously reported failure to rescue polio replication from BFA inhibition by expressing the constitutively activated Arf1Q71L mutant (Belov et al., 2008). Furthermore, we demonstrated that replication of a BFA\u2010resistant polio mutantin the presence of BFA did not induce detectable Arf activation, but was nevertheless strongly dependent on GBF1. This BFA\u2010resistant poliovirus carries two mutations located in viral proteins 3A and 2C, shown to have an additive effect on the level of BFA resistance (Crotty et al., 2004). The N\u2010terminal fragment of GBF1 is known to bind directly to 3A (2006a, 2006b), and functional interaction between 2C and 3A has been implicated by genetic evidence (Teterina et al., 2006).",

            "text": "If the Arf exchange activity of GBF1 is dispensable for polio replication, then why does the catalytically inactive E794K mutant within full\u2010length GBF1 not rescue replication in the presence of BFA? At physiological magnesium concentration, the GBF1\u2010E794K mutant also forms an abortive complex with Arf1 (Beraud\u2010Dufour et al., 1998; Renault et al., 2003), and we propose that this inactive complex, like the full\u2010length GBF1\u2010BFA\u2010Arf1\u2010GDP complex, is equally inaccessible to wild\u2010type polio for viral replication functions. The DCB and HUS domains within the N\u2010terminus of GBF1 interact (Ramaen et al., 2007), and there is evidence that this DCB\u2013HUS interaction affects binding of GBF1 to cellular protein partners (Deng et al., 2009). Thus, domain interactions within GBF1 may play important roles in regulating this large protein's activities. One possibility is that BFA may stabilize a GBF1 conformation that is not ideal for interaction with wild\u2010type polio 3A protein. Mutations in the 2C and 3A proteins in the BFA\u2010resistant poliovirus mutant, however, may allow poliovirus to utilize GBF1 trapped in these inactive complexes more effectively by modifying the 3A\u2013GBF1 interaction.",

Isolated Arf\u2010GTP was eluted, resolved by SDS\u2010PAGE and visualized by immunoblot with anti\u2010Arf antibodies (upper panel). The middle panel shows total Arf in lysates before Arf\u2010GTP pull\u2010down. This membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti\u2010polio 2C antibodies to monitor the development of infection. Mature 2C protein (indicated) as well as several intermediate products of processing of the poliovirus polyprotein are detected (lower panel). B. GBF1 is required for replication of a BFA\u2010resistant polio mutant. HeLa cells were treated with anti\u2010GBF1 siRNA or with the control siRNA. On the third day the cells were transfected with the polio Renilla luciferase replicon harbouring BFA\u2010resistant mutations in the 2C and 3A protein sequences. The cells were incubated with 2 \u00b5g ml\u22121 BFA or corresponding amount of DMSO in the growth medium. Luciferase activity was assayed as a measure of polio replicon replication. The Western blot shows the level of GBF1 depletion; actin immunoblot served as a loading control.",
