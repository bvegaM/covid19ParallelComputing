The construct begins with residue Ser1, and therefore does not contain the full N\u2010terminal auto\u2010cleavage site of the protein. Cells were grown in LB supplemented with ampicillin (50 \u03bcg/mL) at 37 \u00b0C, induced with 1 mm IPTG when the optical density (as determined by absorbance at 600 nm) was 0.8 or greater, and harvested after 4 h. Cells were re\u2010suspended in lysis buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.8), 400 mm NaCl, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton\u2010X, and 10 mm imidazole). The cells were broken by sonicating on ice for short pulses of one second followed by 3 seconds off for a total of 16 min. Cell debris was collected by centrifugation (20 000g at 4 \u00b0C for 45 min). The supernatant was filtered using a 0.45 \u03bcm pore size filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and applied directly to a nickel affinity column (HiTrap Chelating HP, Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) that had been pre\u2010equilibrated with binding buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). The protease was eluted with a linear gradient of 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. After elution, the protein was buffer exchanged into 10 mm Tris\u2013HCl pH 7.5, and loaded onto a Q\u2010sepharose anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences). The protease was eluted with a gradient of 10 mm Tris\u2013HCl, 1 m NaCl, pH 7.5. The pooled fractions containing 3CLpro were exchanged into storage buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm Tris[2\u2010carboxyethyl] phosphine (TCEP), 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and digested for 48 h at 4 \u00b0C with enterokinase (Invitrogen, 0.1 units per 112 \u03bcg of protease) to remove the N\u2010terminal polyhistidine tag. The enterokinase was removed by incubation with EK\u2010away resin (Invitrogen). The reaction mixture was passed through a nickel affinity column to remove undigested protease. The protease was exchanged into storage buffer, concentrated to 10 mg/mL and used immediately for experiments. The sample was more than 95% pure, as assessed by SDS\u2010PAGE.",

            "text": "Pharmacophore models were generated using the Pharmacophore Application module in MOE 2006.0804 (Quebec, Canada). Being a binary model, a threshold of 1000 \u03bcm was selected based on the distribution of K\ni data of the compounds in our database. Compounds with activity (K\ni in our case) lower than the threshold were chosen as active and those with potency higher than the threshold were inactive. A low energy multi\u2010conformational database of all the compounds in the library were generated using the MMFF94x force field, with a cutoff on the strain energy to be <4 kcal/mol. The pharmacophore annotation scheme PPCH_ALL, provided by MOE, was used to calculate the planar, polar, charged, and hydrophobic features including all hydrophobes for the conformation library\nb\n. The model was optimized in a training set database of 22 compounds, with 15 active compounds (K\ni < 1000 \u03bcm) and seven inactive compounds (K\ni > 1000 \u03bcm). The structure and activity of all 22 compounds are shown in Table S1 of the Supplementary Material. Based on this breakdown, an ideal model would select only the active compounds (positive controls) from the training database and not the inactive compounds (negative controls) thereby providing an ideal enrichment factor (R\nideal) of 1.5 based on eqn. 3. Flexible alignment of the lowest energy conformation of the most active compounds led to the identification of their critical ligand features. The basic level of this model was the arrangement of the annotation features in a three\u2010dimensional array as shown in Figure 6A. The second level of complexity was further added to this model defining the exclusion regions; compounds with features protruding into these areas were excluded from the model. The final selection criterion was the placement of an external shell which defined the maximum conformational space that can be sampled by molecules. By gradual refinement, the ability of the model to discriminate between active versus inactive compounds was improved. This was gauged by the calculation of an observed enrichment factor (R\nobserved) using eqn. 3 for the training models and the pharmacophores were optimized until R\nobserved = R\nideal. The final model effectiveness was calculated using eqn. 4. (3)\n(4)\n",

            "text": "A possible mechanism for the inactivation step (Scheme 2) is thought to be initiated by the thiolate imidazolium ion pair at the active site towards the warhead carbonyl, leading to the formation of a thiohemiketal complex which subsequently undergoes an alkylation reaction to form the irreversible product (38). The halomethyl group (A in Scheme 2) makes the adjacent ketone group more susceptible to nucleophilic attack. In the presence of a thiol group, the warhead attains the tetrahedral conformation that resembles the enzyme\u2013substrate intermediate formed during substrate catalysis (B in Scheme 2). Over time, intramolecular rearrangement leads to the alkylation with the adjacent carbon of the halomethyl group with the final structure (C in Scheme 2). Another possibility is the attack of the thiolate ion on the halomethyl carbon adjacent to the warhead carbonyl which then leads to the alkylated product.",

            "text": "Since Compounds 1\u20133 have similar warheads, the differences in their activity can be attributed only to the changes in the P1 position. The compound with the highest inhibitory potency, Compound 1 had a K\ni of 306 \u00b1 10 nm as shown in Table 1. The naphthalene substitution at the P1 position of Compound 2 reduced the potency to a K\ni of 371 \u00b1 15 nm. The addition of fluorine at the para position of the phenyl ring at P1 did not change the potency of Compound 3 (K\ni = 380 \u00b1 31 nm). Although Gln is traditionally present at this position, a hydrophobic moiety is also highly tolerated. This tolerance is consistent with previous studies where the modifications to the P1 position included a lactam ring in the S stereochemistry (19), keto\u2010glutamine analogs with a phenyl group at P1 (39) and \u03b1,\u03b2 unsaturated ester (40); all of which showed a stark improvement in the inhibitory potency of the compounds to the protease. Compound 4, with a bromomethyl ketone warhead and an aliphatic substitution at the P1 position had a K\ni value of 400 \u00b1 71 nm and may also bind in a similar conformation. Compound 5, with a monofluoromethyl ketone warhead had a K\ni value of 512 \u00b1 25 nm. Altering the methyl ester at the P1 position of this compound into a carboxylic acid, completely rendered it inactive with a K\ni > 1000 \u03bcm (Table S1 in Supplementary Material). This indicated that the larger footprint occupied by the dipeptidic compounds leads to an altered conformation of the compound when compared to monopeptidic compounds. The P1 substitution in this orientation fits into a hydrophobic pocket that is more sensitive to structural changes. This hydrophobic moiety provides additional van der Waals interactions at this site that improve the affinity of the ligands.",

Substrate analogues with chloromethyl ketones have been shown to inhibit Cathepsin B and Papain whereas fluoromethyl ketones have shown activity against Caspases, Calpains and Cathepsin B as well (37, 42, 43, 44). Furthermore, NMR experiments have indicated that fluoromethyl and chloromethyl ketones are able to activate the carbonyl carbon of the ketone facilitating the formation of a thio\u2010hemiketal at the active site of cysteine proteases (37). A high rate of inactivation (k\n3) is related to the ability of the warhead to accept a nucleophilic attack by the thiol side chain leading to the eventual alkylation. The inactivation constant k\n3 for Compound 2 (2.8 \u00b1 0.5 \u00d7 10\u22122/second) was almost twice that of Compound 1 (1.5 \u00b1 0.1 \u00d7 10\u22122/second) and, 3 (1.8 \u00b1 0.7 \u00d7 10\u22122/second) (Table 1). The larger P1 moiety of Compound 2 may orient the warhead in a conformation more favourable for reacting with the thiol side chain of Cys 145. The inactivation constant of the dipeptide compound 5 was 1.6 \u00b1 0.1 \u00d7 10\u22122/second, which was similar to Compounds 1 and 3. The k\n3 of Compound 4 was too small to be measured accurately in the kinetic assay (\u226a0.005 \u00d7 10\u22122/second), indicating that the irreversible step is very slow and that for several hours the compound behaves as a reversible inhibitor. In fact, the activity of the protease was completely recovered after incubation in 20 \u03bcm Compound 4 (50 times the K\ni) for 10 min. In the case of complete irreversible inhibition, the protease would have been inactivated at such high inhibitor concentrations. In the case of reversible interaction however, activity can be recovered when the inhibitor concentration is diluted. Irreversibility in the enzyme activity was only noticed after incubation times exceeding 12 hours at a high concentration of Compound 4 (data not shown).",

Also, the inactivation constants (k\n3) of the compounds in this study are lower than those reported for other dipeptidyl halomethyl ketones against human Cathepsin B (37).

The pharmacophore model defines the orientation of essential features that make up the scaffold of the library of lead compounds. The viability of each model during the optimization process was determined by accessing the ability to discriminate between true and false positives. In order to generate an accurate model, maximum structural diversity from the compounds in the training set was incorporated by setting a threshold value of 1000 \u03bcm. The pharmacophore model was generated based on this activity data combined with the structural information of the compounds (Table 5). The final, refined pharmacophore model as shown in Figure 6A contained the following features: A non\u2010planar hydrophobic feature with a sphere radius of 1.1 \u00c5 (red), a planar donor feature with a sphere radius of 1.2 \u00c5 (purple), a planar hydrophobic or a non\u2010planar hydrophobic feature with a sphere radius of 1.2 \u00c5 (blue), a planar acceptor or planar donor feature with a sphere radius of 1.3 \u00c5 (yellow), and a planar hydrophobic feature with a sphere radius of 1.5 \u00c5 (green). This model selected only the active molecules in the training database providing a R\nobserved value of 1.5. For the selected threshold, the theoretical effectiveness of this model, calculated as the ratio of the R\nobserved and R\nideal, (eqn 4) was 100%. The applicability of this model can be better visualized by examining a molecule selected on the basis of the structural constraints imposed by the model (Figure 6B). A non\u2010planar hydrophobic feature defined the region corresponding to the warhead of the molecule. The structural features defining the P1 subsite were a planar hydrophobic or a non\u2010planar hydrophobic feature. This result agrees with the kinetic data discussed earlier and indicates that the compounds with the highest affinity to 3CLpro have either a phenyl planar moiety or a flexible aliphatic chain (Table 1).",

            "text": "The pharmacophore model defined above was validated by using a conformational database of approximately 1 000 000 compounds provided by MOE. The pharmacophore search of the test set resulted in the selection of 40 molecules as hits. The hypothesis for this binary model was that the selected molecules would inhibit 3CLpro with a K\ni of 1000 \u03bcm or lower; the unselected molecules will have a K\ni greater than the threshold. Based on this hypothesis, the R\nideal was calculated to be 26315.8 using eqn 3. A common feature of the compounds that were hits was the presence of a halomethyl ketone group possessing an adjacent aromatic moiety. When the ability of the 40 selected compounds to inhibit 3CLpro was measured, 38 out of 40 had K\ni\n\u2019s below 1000 \u03bcm and 2 were false positives with K\ni\n\u2019s greater than the threshold resulting in a R\nobserved of 25 000. Based on these results, an observed effectiveness of the model to 95% was calculated. The data from the best compounds from this validation step are shown in Table 4. These results provided evidence to the accuracy of the pharmacophore model. The compound with the highest affinity had a K\ni of 4.5 \u00b1 1 \u03bcm which is encouraging, based on the fact that the compound was chosen from a database not specialized for halomethyl ketones, using a pharmacophore that had a broad threshold. This initial model performed well in both the training and a randomly chosen test set databases, establishing itself as an attractive scaffold that can be further optimized. Some unexpected warheads with moderate affinities such as Product 1 and Product 2 in Table 4 were also recovered. In the first optimization cycle, the activity data from this validation step was used to further refine the pharmacophore by reducing the threshold limit and consequently the sensitivity of the model. Eventually, a highly specialized pharmacophore will be developed that would select for high affinity compounds against 3CLpro with features defined in the model.",

In this paper, we have shown that halomethyl ketones can be potent and selective inhibitors of the SARS protease 3CLpro. While inhibitors like Compound 4 end up forming a covalent thioether complex, they do so in a very slow fashion (over 6 h) allowing the binding reaction to be controlled by reversible thermodynamic interactions. Compound 4 binds with favourable enthalpy and entropy changes. Since Compound 4 has a molecular weight of only 400.26 Da, it has the potential for much improved potency and selectivity.",
