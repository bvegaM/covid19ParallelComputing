We have also investigated T-cell-receptor (TCR) V\u03b22 expression in the small intestinal mucosa of KD patients14 and found that these cells were selectively increased in the mucosa of patients in the acute phase of KD compared with controls.",

Most of the searches for an aetiologic agent in KD have been carried out for a single infectious agent. However, a more plausible underlying principle is that there is cooperation between different mechanisms of different causative bacteria, and a final common pathway of immune activation is responsible for the clinical disorder and complications.8,26 Recently, the issue has been raised as to whether the provoking antigen in KD might be a conventional antigen or a sAg.27\u201330 Although the debate continues regarding the mechanism of initial immune activation, the most likely scenario is that sAg and conventional peptide antigens work together to direct a persistent immune response leading to coronary artery damage.26 A unifying model proposed that a microbe with superantigenic activity initiates massive activation of the developing immune system. A subpopulation of sAg-responsive T cells is rescued from apoptosis as a result of interaction with costimulatory signals between antigen-presenting cells and a conventional peptide antigen. This peptide antigen may be derived from itself or an infectious mimic of itself. The immune response is perpetuated locally where the self-antigen is found on the coronary vessels.",

One may be concerned with the description of S. oralis, S. sanguinis and S. mitis as superantigenic strains because they are generally not known as superantigenic strains. Very few reports on the sAg activity of S. mitis have been published,31,32 and sAg activity for S. oralis and S. sanguinis has not yet been confirmed, except for some interesting findings suggesting the possibilities of toxic shock-like syndrome caused by viridans streptococci to which those strains belong and sAg-related toxigenic conversion between streptococcus species.33,34 However, these findings did not directly support the production of sAg by those strains. Further investigations in this respect are obviously required. Autologous PBMCs may be problematic because T cells bearing a certain TCR would be stimulated in an oligoclonal manner and would eventually become anergic. However, we demonstrated that PBMCs obtained from patients during the convalescent phase of KD had the capacity to respond to sAg, probably because some T-cell subsets bearing T\u03b22 were not anergized or the T cells had never been exposed to sAg in these young children. The reason why the IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 production induced by BCS containing sAg was not markedly higher than that induced by BCS without sAg may be explained likewise in that a handful of T cells which respond to sAg in the convalescent sample could produce moderately high amounts of those cytokines.",

Furthermore, bacterial hsp60\u201370 seemed to possess a certain homology, together with self-hsps.
