To minimize length bias, only illnesses in which HBoV was detected in the first 2 samples obtained (within \u223c1 week of illness onset) were considered to be HBoV-positive illnesses. In response to a number of lowcopy HBoV-positive samples that were detectable by only 1 of 2 PCR assays, a sensitivity analysis was performed that required a quantitative value of at least 4 log-copies per mL to determine positivity. This cutoff value was determined by rounding the 25th quartile quantity in our results to the nearest log. A corresponding cutoff of a cycle threshold value of 35.3 was used for samples with insufficient volume for quantitative testing; this cutoff value was selected because it linearly corresponds to 4 log-copies/mL, based on our data. As a secondary analysis, characteristics of HBoV-positive illnesses were compared with the characteristics of HBoV-negative illnesses immediately preceding and following the case event in each individual with use of a bidirectional case-crossover analysis design. This comparison was analyzed with generalized estimating equations with robust variance. Because this analysis required both an HBoVpositive illness and a separate HBoV-negative illness for the inclusion of each child, the available dataset was markedly smaller than the full study analysis described above.",

No association was found between HBoV detection and the presence of the following symptoms: fever, wheezing, cough, rhinorrhea, congestion, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite or activity, earache, fatigue, myalgia, malaise, rash, or difficulty breathing. However, extended respiratory illness, defined as symptoms other than rhinorrhea lasting longer than >7 days, was more common among children with HBoVpositive illnesses than it was among children with HBoV-negative illnesses (odds ratio [OR], 2.44; 95% CI, 1.41\u20134.22;P = .001). Specifically, HBoV-positive illnesses had higher odds of being associated with a cough lasting <7 days (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.29\u20133.39;P = .003). Illness due to HBoV alone (ie, with no coinfecting viruses) was not associated with any outcomes (including duration of cough, duration of illness, and number of health care provider visits), compared with HBoVnegative illness; however, the number of HBoV monoinfections was small (30 cases). Our results were not affected by controlling for age. One child with HBoV infection was admitted to the hospital for severe respiratory illness; this child was also infected with RSV, CoV, HRV, and AdV during the course of the illness.",

We also found that HBoV detection did not have a distinct seasonal pattern, compared with the overall distribution of all respiratory illnesses over a 2-year period, in contrast with other reports [8, 17\u201319].

We did not find a difference in HBoV prevalence between asymptomatic samples and the next illness sample within each child. This analysis design has the advantage of allowing for the control of confounding by individual factors, such as age.

We documented shedding for up to 75 days with regular sampling. This reflects reports of extended shedding for at least 2 months in 32% of children with HBoVpositive respiratory illness who underwent monthly testing [8]. We also described extended shedding events that spanned the onset and resolution of multiple consecutive respiratory illnesses. The persistence of HBoV shedding beyond the resolution of single respiratory illnesses illustrates the difficulty in correlating an isolated HBoV-positive result with an incident illness in a cross-sectional study. Given that we have demonstrated that multiple HBoV-related events separated by periods in which HBoV-negative swab samples are obtained are possible in individual children, it is possible that persistent HBoV detection reported here and elsewhere [8, 17, 25] may be attributable to repeated infections, rather than to a single extended period of shedding. More frequent sample collection is needed to fully investigate this possibility.",
