A critical step in this response is the adhesion of circulating leukocytes to the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels, allowing their subsequent migration across the endothelial cell barrier to access the insult. Damaged or infected tissues are rich in vasoactive peptides, chemoattractants, and other products that stimulate the endothelial cells and leukocytes to induce or activate cell surface molecules that mediate the adhesion and transmigration processes [1, 2].",

In addition to its enzymatic regulation of neuroregulatory and vasoactive peptides [10, 11], CD13 is the receptor for a prominent subgroup of coronaviruses including the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV\u2010229E) [12]. Structurally, CD13 consists of a large extracellular domain containing the enzymatic active site, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail with no known signaling motifs. Thus, it is believed that CD13 is intrinsically incapable of signaling and may function as a signal regulator of other molecules [13, 14]. Recently, we and others have reported that cross\u2010linking CD13 by antibodies results in monocytic cell activation via signal transduction\u2010dependent mechanisms [15, 17]. This activation is characterized by increased FcR\u2010mediated phagocytosis [15], Ca++ flux, and cytokine secretion [16] and an increase in the adhesive capacity of the cells [17]. The CD13\u2010induced cell\u2013cell adhesion was demonstrated to be dependent on the carbohydrate\u2010binding protein galectin\u20103 and independent of CD13 enzymatic activity [18].",

Our results indicate that monocytic cell activation by ligand\u2010mimicking antibodies or a natural CD13 ligand, HCoV\u2010229E, results in a dramatic, signal transduction\u2010dependent increase in adhesion to the endothelium that is distinct from that induced by inflammatory cytokines. This adhesion requires CD13 clustering and involves complexes containing monocytic and endothelial CD13, suggesting a direct participation of CD13 in this process. Importantly, blocking CD13 interactions with specific antibodies or soluble CD13 (sCD13) abrogates the effect. Finally, blocking CD13 interactions in vivo with specific antibodies results in a reduction in peritoneal leukocyte infiltration in a murine model of peritonitis, supporting a fundamental role for CD13 in leukocyte transendothelial migration into inflammatory sites.",

Each condition was assayed in triplicate. Unbound monocytic cells were washed away, and the remaining cells were lysed. For a detailed description, see Supplemental Methods. Fluorescence was quantified in a CytoFluor 4000 (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA, USA). Data represent the fluorescence obtained from each sample normalized against the fluorescence corresponding to cells adhered onto untreated controls.

            "text": "In previous studies, we observed that pretreatment of monocytes and monocytic cells with anti\u2010CD13 mAb induced rapid cell\u2013cell adhesion in a signal transduction\u2010dependent but enzymatic activity\u2010independent manner [17]. As CD13 is expressed on monocytes and the endothelial cells of tumor vessels [7, 9], vessels in the ischemic heart [25], and has been shown to be up\u2010regulated by inflammatory cytokines [26, 27, 28, 29], we asked if ligation of CD13 would influence the monocyte/endothelial interactions that are critical to monocyte trafficking during inflammation. Pretreatment of primary HUVEC (which express high levels of CD13 in response to growth factors in the culture medium [8, 9]) with the anti\u2010CD13 mAb 452 prior to addition of labeled U\u2010937 monocytic cells significantly induced monocytic cell adhesion (\nFig. 1A\n). Importantly, adhesion was not induced when cells were pretreated with mAb at 4\u00b0C (data not shown), suggesting that the induction of adhesion was an active process and that it was not a result of cell\u2013cell association via unbound Fab portions of the mAb binding to CD13 molecules on the opposite cell. To strengthen this conclusion, we produced stable cell lines expressing the V5 epitope\u2010tagged, full\u2010length hCD13 in a CD13\u2010negative human epithelial cell line C33A (hCD13\u2010C33A) and assayed these for antibody\u2010induced monocytic cell adhesion. Although the high expression of CD13 on these transfectants had no effect on the basal adhesion of monocytic cells (see 2., Fig. 3C), pretreatment of the hCD13\u2010C33A with anti\u2010CD13 mAb 452 or an anti\u2010V5 antibody was capable of inducing similar increases in adhesion over a wide range of doses, although maximal induction was observed with low antibody concentrations (Fig. 1B). As the V5 epitope is only expressed by the cells in the monolayer, this result clearly demonstrates that anti\u2010CD13\u2010dependent adhesion is not the result of single antibodies simultaneously binding to the CD13 on both cell populations but more likely by influencing the intrinsic, adhesive properties of the cells.",

            "text": "We expanded our investigation using three additional anti\u2010CD13 mAb of varying epitope specificities to pretreat HUVEC (summarized in Table 1). Maximal induction of monocytic cell\u2010endothelial cell adhesion was observed with two independent mAb, 452 and Y2\u2010K (Fig. 1C), which recognize a common epitope (Supplemental Fig. 1) that has been shown to be important for HCoV\u2010229E infection [20]. In contrast, pretreatment of HUVEC with the WM\u201015 mAb that recognizes a distinct epitope and inhibits CD13 enzymatic activity [31] showed a more modest, yet significant induction of monocytic cell adhesion. A third reagent, mAb WM\u20104.7, does not inhibit viral infection, does not block enzymatic activity [31, 32], and as expected, had no effect on monocytic cell adhesion to HUVEC, nor did treatment of cells with bestatin, a chemical inhibitor of CD13 enzymatic activity. Interestingly, pretreatment of the adhering monocytic cells with anti\u2010CD13 mAb prior to addition of the untreated endothelial monolayer produced an identical pattern of antibody\u2010dependent adhesion (Fig. 1D), with an even higher effect than when pretreating HUVEC (average 54.1% higher adhesion of treated U\u2010937 vs. treated HUVEC). Thus, it would appear that shared critical regions of the CD13 molecule participate in each of its various functions and that CD13 ligation affects adhesion properties of monocytic cells and endothelial cells. Importantly, when primary PBMC were used in place of the U\u2010937 cell line, we observed a similar dramatic increase in adhesion to HUVEC when the PBMC or HUVEC were pretreated with the mAb (Fig. 1E). Similarly, primary macrophages and lung microvascular endothelial cells behave analogously (see Supplemental Fig. 5). As monocytes and a small percentage of granulocytes are the only CD13+ populations in PBMC, these results clearly demonstrate that ligation of endothelial or myeloid cell CD13 with specific antibodies induces adhesion of primary myeloid cells and monocytic cell lines. Thus, the U\u2010937 cell line is a valid model for primary monocyte/endothelial interactions, as previously reported [34, 35, 36, 37]. We determined the kinetics of CD13\u2010induced adhesion to endothelial monolayers (Supplemental Fig. 2). Although pretreatment with anti\u2010CD13 antibodies for various time periods rapidly induced significant adhesion, the adhesion appears to be transient, where the number of monocytic cells attached to the monolayer decreases progressively, perhaps suggesting that subsequent to initial adhesion, the cells become refractory and are no longer able to adhere.",

In experiments to determine if the differences in the ability of anti\u2010CD13 antibodies to induce adhesion were a result of their ability to cross\u2010link CD13 molecules on the cell surface, we found that F(ab)\u20322 fragments of the 452 mAb but not its Fab fragments were capable of inducing monocytic cell adhesion when preincubated with U\u2010937 cells (\nFig. 2A\n), and the binding capacity of the two reagents was comparable (Fig. 2A, inset). Similarly, cross\u2010linking of the nonactivating mAb WM\u20104.7 with F(ab)\u20322 fragments of a secondary antibody results in high levels of adhesion similar to those obtained with equivalent fragments of the mAb 452. Identical results were obtained with HUVEC (not shown). In addition, as the antibody fragments are capable of inducing adhesion, this effect is not mediated by FcRs on the opposite cell. CD13 clustering by activating but not inactive antibodies can be visualized by confocal imaging of U\u2010937 cells treated with fluorescently labeled antibodies, where only the adhesion\u2010inducing 452 mAb but not the noninducing WM\u20104.7 can cluster CD13 molecules on the cell surface (Fig. 2B). Similar CD13 aggregates were observed when HUVEC (Supplemental Fig. 3, A and B), hCD13\u2010C33A cells (not shown), or a mouse endothelial cell line (EOMA, Fig. 2B) expressing GFP\u2010tagged hCD13 were treated with the 452 mAb as compared with untreated cells. Thus, as reported for homotypic aggregation (HA) [17], clustering of membrane\u2010bound CD13 is required to alter the adhesive properties of the cell.",

To further delineate the scope of induction of adhesion by CD13 cross\u2010linking and to determine if natural ligands that cross\u2010link CD13 also induce monocytic cell/endothelial cell adhesion, we tested the effect of treatment of monocytic cells with UV\u2010irradiated HCoV\u2010229E. Monocytic cells treated with inactivated virus (which contain \u223c200 trimeric spikes/virion) showed a dose\u2010dependent increase in adhesion (Fig. 2C). The dose/response curve suggests a cross\u2010linking\u2010dependent process. Taken together, these results demonstrate that clustering of CD13 by a specific mAb or by a natural multivalent ligand, HcoV\u2010229E, increases cell adhesiveness. This process may be exploited by the virus to manipulate immune cell behavior.",

To investigate if CD13 localization on endothelial or other target cells would also support a role for CD13 as an adhesion molecule, we assessed the distribution of CD13 on GFP\u2010tagged, CD13\u2010expressing C33A or EOMA cells (\nFig. 3A\n) or on HUVEC monolayers stained with immunofluorescently labeled anti\u2010CD13 mAb (Supplemental Fig. 3C). In isolated cells of all types studied, CD13 was relatively evenly distributed in the cell membrane (Fig. 3A and Supplemental Video 1) but appeared to concentrate at points of contact when other cells were encountered, as previously reported in other cell types (ref. [30]; Figs. 3A, center, and 2B). Similarly, live\u2010cell imaging of mAb\u2010treated monocytic cells adhering to untreated C33A cells expressing a GFP\u2010tagged CD13 showed that CD13 was strongly expressed in filopodial structures protruding from the monolayer toward the adhering monocytic cells (Fig. 3A, right, and Supplemental Videos 2\u20134).

If this were the case, CD13 must be expressed on both cell types for antibody\u2010induced adhesion to occur. Indeed, as shown in Figure 3C, using the V5\u2010tagged, CD13\u2010transfected cells described above (hCD13\u2010C33A), we found that anti\u2010CD13, mAb\u2010activated monocytic cells bind exclusively to CD13\u2010expressing monolayers and not to nontransfected or vector\u2010transfected controls, demonstrating that its expression is required to mediate adhesion. Additionally, mAb\u2010treated monocytic cells did not bind to mAb\u2010blocked hCD13\u2010C33A monolayers, presumably by blocking CD13 homophilic interactions.

To investigate this question, U\u2010937 cells were activated with a biotinylated form of anti\u2010CD13 mAb 452, washed, and allowed to adhere to V5\u2010tagged, CD13\u2010transfected monolayers (hCD13\u2010C33A). Monocytic CD13 was immunoprecipitated from total lysates of these cocultures using streptavidin beads, and the resulting complexes were probed for the presence of the monolayer\u2010expressed V5 epitope (\nFig. 4A\n). V5\u2010tagged proteins corresponding to the molecular weight of mature CD13 were readily apparent in lysates from conditions containing monolayers expressing full\u2010length CD13 but not on nontransfected or vector\u2010transfected control monolayers or cells expressing a V5\u2010tagged tCD13 lacking the extracellular domains (htCD13), verifying the specificity of the precipitated band. Importantly, a nonspecific interaction with the V5 epitope is ruled out by the lack of V5\u2010tagged tCD13 in complexes with immunoprecipitated monocytic cell CD13 (not shown). Similarly, excess antibody is not responsible for the coimmunoprecipitation, as V5\u2010tagged proteins are not precipitated when the individual populations are first lysed and then mixed prior to immunoprecipitation, thus preventing endothelial/monocytic cell interaction (data not shown). Additionally, we observed a dose\u2010dependent abrogation of adhesion of mAb\u2010activated monocytic cells to HUVEC when the monocytic cells were treated with a truncated recombinant sCD13 [20], even when the protein was no longer present during the adhesion assay, and basal adhesion was unaffected, further supporting a direct CD13\u2013CD13 interaction (Fig. 4B). However, in the reciprocal experiment, treatment of mAb\u2010activated HUVEC with sCD13 showed a significant but clearly less efficient inhibition of adhesion (Fig. 4C), unless the protein was allowed to remain during the assay, signifying that it preferentially binds to mAb\u2010treated, monocytic cells as compared with mAb\u2010treated HUVEC. This suggests a more complex CD13\u2013CD13 interaction that may involve the exposure of auxiliary molecules or ligands on monocytic cells after CD13 clustering and that the soluble form of the protein is capable of regulating this interaction. Alternatively, differential glycosylation of the CD13 molecule may play a role, as it has been proposed that at least five different glycoforms of CD13 exist [32, 41]. Finally, mAb\u2010treated but not resting monocytic cells specifically adhered to immobilized, purified sCD13 in a dose\u2010dependent manner (Fig. 4D), confirming that CD13 can function as an adhesion molecule to mediate the interaction of monocytic cells with target cells.",

However, antibody\u2010induced adhesion requires signal transduction cascades in monocytic cells and endothelial cells, as preincubation of either cell type with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin prior to antibody treatment profoundly inhibited antibody\u2010induced adhesion with no effect on basal adhesion at the concentrations used (\nFig. 5A\n). In contrast, G protein\u2010coupled receptor signaling is not involved, as pretreatment of the monocytic cells with pertussis toxin prior to antibody activation did not affect CD13\u2010induced adhesion (data not shown). These results suggest that the adhesion induced by CD13 ligation requires signaling cascades in both cell types and that blocking these mechanisms in one cell population influences the induction of adhesion by CD13 ligation on the opposite cell. Interestingly, the signaling cascades triggered in monocytic cells consistently appear to predominate over those induced in HUVEC, as adhesion is always more potently affected when monocytic signal transduction mechanisms are inhibited, regardless of which cell type is treated with the mAb (Fig. 5A).",

We have shown that during anti\u2010CD13 mAb\u2010induced monocytic adhesion, CD13 is clearly concentrated at the leading edge of monocytic cells that are migrating toward cellular aggregates and is actively redistributed to the zones of cell\u2013cell contact in aggregated cells [17]. Similarly, CD13 redistributes to the phagocytic cups during Fc\u03b3R\u2010mediated phagocytosis [15] and is enriched at the leading edge and in the membrane projections of endothelial cells (Fig. 3A), demonstrating that CD13 frequently accumulates at the sites of actin microfilament\u2010driven processes. To determine whether microfilament assembly plays a role in CD13\u2010induced adhesion, we inhibited this process with cytochalasin\u2010D and assessed adhesion following anti\u2010CD13 mAb treatment of endothelial cells (Fig. 5B) or monocytic cells (Fig. 5C). When endothelial cell CD13 is ligated, CD13\u2010induced adhesion is essentially unaffected by blocking endothelial actin polymerization (Fig. 5B, Lanes 2 and 3). This is analogous to previous reports studying microvillar structures during leukocyte trafficking (similar to those in Fig. 3A) in TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010activated endothelial cells [39, 44]. In contrast, pretreatment or persistent treatment of monocytic cells with cytochalasin\u2010D completely abrogated adhesion to CD13\u2010activated endothelial cells regardless of the status of endothelial cell actin polymerization (Fig. 5B, Lanes 4 and 5), again implying that the downstream consequences of ligation of monocytic CD13 have a greater impact on adhesion than those in endothelial cells. Similarly, in the reciprocal experiment (Fig. 5C), CD13\u2010activated monocytic cells preincubated with cytochalasin\u2010D showed a nearly 70% decrease in adhesion (Fig. 5C, Lane 3) and complete abrogation when the inhibitor was present during the entire assay (not shown) or when both cells are pretreated (Fig. 5C, Lane 5). In addition, cytochalasin treatment of HUVEC did not affect adhesion of mAb\u2010treated monocytic cells (Fig. 5C, Lane 4), clearly demonstrating that microfilament assembly is a principal consequence of CD13\u2010induced signal transduction in monocytic cells. Accordingly, visualization of actin dynamics in CD13\u2010activated monocytic cells with fluorescently labeled phalloidin showed that CD13 cross\u2010linking induced the striking formation of numerous actin\u2010rich, filopodia\u2010like protrusions after antibody activation when compared with untreated cells (Fig. 5D) at time periods consistent with kinetics of antibody\u2010induced adhesion. Similar to this observation, treatment of monocytic cells with activating antibodies induces Ca fluxes (Supplemental Fig. 4 and refs. [16, 45]). In contrast, antibody\u2010treated HUVEC showed no discernable difference in actin localization (data not shown) in agreement with the cytochalasin inhibition data and arguing that CD13 cross\u2010linking in endothelial cells induces downstream consequences that are qualitatively distinct from those seen in monocytic cells.",

To determine the effects of CD13 ligation on inflammatory transendothelial migration in vivo, we induced peritonitis in mice treated i.v. with either vehicle, control IgG, or anti\u2010murine CD13 antibodies (which we determined can induce monocytic cell adhesion; Supplemental Fig. 5), and assessed leukocyte infiltration into the peritoneal cavity. Surprisingly, although both cohorts of control animals showed an intense leukocyte infiltration into the peritoneal wall that correlated with the number of peritoneal leukocytes, these numbers were clearly reduced in the anti\u2010CD13 mAb\u2010treated animals (\nFig. 6A\n, \n6B\n, \n6C\n). Interestingly, at this early time\u2010point (16 h), the relative representation of infiltrating granulocytes versus mononuclear cells in the peritoneal fluid did not appear to be affected by anti\u2010CD13 mAb treatment, as determined by direct quantification of the relative number of harvested peritoneal cells (Fig. 6D). Additionally, direct assessment of peripheral blood cell populations by FACS analysis of monocytes (CD11b+/Gr1\u2013) and neutrophils (CD11b/Gr1 double\u2010positive, Fig. 6E) showed equivalent numbers in anti\u2010CD13\u2010treated animals when compared with controls, arguing against antibody\u2010induced cell death as a mechanism for reduced peritoneal infiltration. Therefore, our results indicate that ligation of CD13 significantly affects leukocyte trafficking in vivo and suggest it contributes to inflammatory processes through complex mechanisms.",

Here, we demonstrate that ligation of CD13 on primary human myeloid cells or monocytic cell lines also promotes their adhesion to endothelial cells under in vitro static conditions, which importantly, we find is recapitulated in preliminary studies in physiologic flow (data not shown). We show that the induction of adhesion is strictly dependent on the ability of antibodies to cluster CD13 and requires active tyrosine kinases and CD13 expression on monocytic cells and endothelial cells. Accordingly, the multivalent CD13L, HCoV\u2010229E (which specifically binds and clusters CD13), also induced monocytic cell adhesion to endothelial cells. Thus, treatment of monocytic cells with clustering antibodies functionally duplicates the response to CD13 cross\u2010linking via a natural ligand, underscoring the potential in vivo relevance of this process and demonstrating the use of these antibodies as ligand\u2010mimicking reagents to study CD13\u2010mediated receptor functions.",

However, our observation that sCD13 efficiently blocks the adhesion of anti\u2010CD13\u2010treated monocytic cells but has only a modest effect on mAb\u2010treated HUVEC suggests differential binding as a result of alternately glycosylated CD13 forms or an indirect heterophilic CD13\u2013CD13 interaction, possibly via an \u201cadaptor/bridging\u201d molecule on the monocytic cell that is activated by CD13 cross\u2010linking and enables it to bind to CD13 on the monolayers. The carbohydrate\u2010binding protein galectin\u20103 has been shown to regulate monocyte adhesion and transendothelial migration [51] and is also a CD13L ligand that participates in CD13\u2010induced monocytic cell adhesion [18]. In preliminary studies, CD13\u2010mediated monocytic cell/endothelial interactions are partially blocked by anti\u2010galectin\u20103 antibodies, consistent with a contributory role for galectin\u20103 in CD13\u2010induced adhesion (data not shown). Thus, it is possible that as other adhesion molecules, CD13 establishes homophilic and heterophilic (galectin\u20103\u2010mediated) interactions, which would explain the incomplete block with sCD13 or anti\u2010galectin\u20103 antibodies. A homophilic interaction could be the result of CD13 clustering, inducing an increase in avidity, as has been proposed for integrins, cadherins, and other cellular adhesion molecules [52, 53, 54] and thus, may also participate in CD13\u2010induced adhesion on endothelial cells. Alternatively, clustering could result in a conformational change, exposing cryptic epitopes (as has been reported for anti\u2010CD13 antibodies of the same specificity as our active mAb [32]) that mediate adhesion. In this regard, under basal conditions, CD13 may exist in an \u201cinactive\u201d conformation, which clustering converts to an \u201cactive\u201d, oligomeric conformation now capable of interacting with inactive molecules on the untreated cells. CD13 ligation in both populations would produce only active forms incapable of establishing productive interactions and may explain the impaired inflammatory cell infiltration in vivo in the presence of antibodies (see below). The fact that sCD13 only blocks clustered CD13 suggests that it is in an inactive conformation (perhaps as a result of alternative glycosylation), which also explains its inability to induce adhesion.",

In monocytic cells, the principal result of CD13 clustering appears to be a signaling event involving tyrosine phosphorylation and Ca++ fluxing (Supplemental Fig. 4), as shown for other anti\u2010CD13 mAb [16]. Extending these observations, we show that these processes result in requisite actin polymerization, as demonstrated by complete abrogation of CD13\u2010induced adhesion by cytochalasin\u2010D. Subsequently, CD13\u2010induced actin polymerization leads to the formation of filopodial structures, as seen with cross\u2010linking of other membrane receptors and other activating stimuli [43, 55]. These filopodial structures express high levels of adhesion molecules and membrane enzymes at their tips [56, 57, 58], underscoring the potential relevance of CD13\u2010induced filopodia formation in monocyte adhesion. Pertinent to our study, some viruses use filopodia to increase the efficiency of infection and possibly for receptor interaction [59, 60]. As HCoV\u2010229E cross\u2010linking of CD13 increases monocytic cell adhesion, these may induce filopodia formation and thereby modulate physiologic processes to their advantage. Exploration of the consequences of active HCoV\u2010229E infection on monocyte adhesion is underway.",

Although we initially expected an increase in migration as a result of increased adhesion, our additional observations would also be consistent with decreased transmigration in the presence of anti\u2010CD13 mAb. As we have excluded cell death as a result of antibody\u2010dependent mechanisms, the most straightforward explanation is that the continuous presence of circulating mAb blocks CD13 adhesion, presumably as a result of blocking binding sites or \u201chyperactivating\u201d endothelial and monocytic CD13 to preclude binding, similar to our in vitro observations. Alternatively, although the effect of CD13 cross\u2010linking on monocytic cell adhesion is apparent within 5 min of addition to the endothelial monolayer, our in vitro kinetic studies indicate that the adhesion diminishes to less than 50% of original values after 1 h of coculture, suggesting that the cells bind transiently and then detach, consistent with our observations in homotypic leukocyte adhesion [17]. It is possible that the signal induced by CD13 ligation is biphasic, first inducing adhesion via CD13\u2013CD13 interactions and at later times, is antiadhesive, perhaps rendering cells refractory to subsequent adhesion via classical pathways. Another potential explanation is the CD13 ligation\u2010dependent induction of HA, which if it occurs in vivo, could prevent monocyte/endothelial interactions and transmigration. However, we see no evidence of cellular aggregates in our examination of tissues from treated versus untreated animals, nor are cells aggregated in the adhesion assays at any time of our time\u2010points. Finally, we cannot exclude the interaction of anti\u2010CD13 antibodies with circulating sCD13, which may possibly affect transmigration by an undetermined mechanism. Experiments to distinguish among these possibilities are currently under way. Finally, the blocked infiltration of multiple cell types in this model implies that CD13 may regulate migration of other immune cells such as neutrophils and activated T cells that also express significant amounts of CD13 [11].",

Furthermore, the present study is relevant to diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases associated with cytomegalovirus infection that produce high\u2010titer circulating, anti\u2010CD13 autoantibodies of the same epitope specificity as our activating clones [17], which could potentially play a role in these inflammatory processes [68, 69].
