Human pDC are phenotypically defined by lack of expression of T and B cell and monocyte markers and by expression of MHC class II and the IL\u20103 receptor CD123 [25, 52], and similar markers can be used to define pDC in non\u2010human primate species [8, 15, 37, 44, 58]. pDC recognize single\u2010stranded viral RNA via endosomal toll\u2010like receptor (TLR)7 [18, 35], and HIV and SIV activate pDC to produce IFN\u2010\u03b1 through virus RNA engagement of this receptor, although a role for TLR9 remains a possibility [3, 39, 40]. pDC\u2010derived IFN directly controls virus infection in murine coronavirus and herpes simplex virus models [12, 36] and controls HIV infection in vitro [26, 41]. However, the role of pDC in either controlling HIV replication or exacerbating pathogenesis is controversial.",

It has been hypothesized that infection is associated with recruitment of pDC to inflamed lymph nodes that draw cells from blood resulting in a deficit of circulating pDC [2, 24, 42]. In mice, pDC are recruited to inflamed lymph nodes through CXCR3 interaction with CXCL9 and CXCL10 [11, 60], and expression of these chemokines is markedly increased in SIV infection of macaques [46, 47]. pDC activate T cells both through direct contact and elaboration of IFN\u2010\u03b1 [5, 41], and the increased number of activated CD4+ T cells could negatively impact lentivirus pathogenesis by fueling virus replication and CD4+ T cell depletion. Substantial pDC recruitment has been reported to occur within 1 day of vaginal exposure of rhesus macaques to SIV associated with elaboration of pDC\u2010derived chemokines and attraction of large numbers of CD4+ T cell targets to mucosal tissues [32]. Recent studies have indicated that CD4+ T cells from HIV\u2010infected lymph nodes are hyperactive because of the effects of IFN and upregulated IFN\u2010stimulated genes [28, 50]. Moreover, comparative studies have shown that the acute IFN response is rapidly controlled in SIV\u2010infected African green monkeys and sooty mangabeys, which do not progress to disease, but is sustained in rhesus macaques, which do progress to disease [7, 29].",

However, little is known about the kinetics of the pDC response to acute SIV and HIV infection, and in chronic progressive SIV and HIV infection there is profound depletion of pDC from lymph nodes [4, 9, 45].

Interestingly, we found that pDC were present in normal numbers in bone marrow but were lost from blood and lymph nodes within 14 days of intravenous infection with SIVmac251, despite evidence of a profound mobilization of pDC into blood and recruitment to lymph nodes. In lymph nodes, pDC were uniformly activated and more likely to be apoptotic than in uninfected animals, and a significant proportion of pDC were infected with virus [10]. These findings show that pDC are recruited to inflamed lymph nodes in SIV infection, as predicted. However, the hostile inflammatory environment within these tissues favors pDC activation and death that exceeds the capacity for pDC replacement, resulting in a net pDC loss.",

In general, cell suspensions were labeled with a panel of monoclonal antibodies to CD3, CD14 and CD20 (conjugated to the same fluorochrome and combined as a lineage cocktail), CD45, HLA\u2010DR and CD123 along with a live/dead viability dye to exclude dead cells [8]. In some experiments, additional antibodies to BrdU, Ki\u201067, TNF\u2010\u03b1, IFN\u2010\u03b1 or CD95 were used. Apoptosis was determined by labeling with 7\u2010AAD and Annexin\u2010V. To accurately count cells in blood, we developed a combined whole blood/peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) assay [8]. This is a two\u2010step assay that involves (i) antibody staining and analysis of a precise volume of whole blood to identify and count CD45 + mononuclear cells in TruCOUNT tubes, which contain a known number of fluorescent beads that serve as an internal calibrator and (ii) multiparameter analysis of PBL to determine the percentage of mononuclear cells that are pDC. The pDC percentage in PBL is multiplied by the absolute number of mononuclear cells calculated from whole blood to determine the number of pDC in a unit volume of whole blood [8]. Analysis of pDC in PBL as opposed to whole blood is preferred as the lineage\u2212 MHC class II+ cells, and DC subsets are poorly discriminated in whole blood but are readily defined in PBL in our experience. This method has revealed that normal rhesus macaque blood contains an average of 2.5 pDC/ul, 20\u2010fold fewer than the number of myeloid DC [8].",

BrdU is a thymidine analog that is incorporated into actively dividing cells and can be identified within cells following permeabilization and antibody labeling. BrdU incorporation into pDC can be used to track the exodus of pDC from bone marrow and the entrance into blood and tissues, as murine studies have indicated that pDC do not undergo proliferation in peripheral tissues under physiologic conditions [34], and our preliminary data indicate that the same is true for pDC in blood and tissues of SIV\u2010infected macaques [10]. Hence, any BrdU+ pDC in blood or tissues will be marked as having been released from the bone marrow since the time of the BrdU pulse. BrdU staining was complemented by antibody staining against the nuclear antigen Ki\u201067 that is expressed by cells in non\u2010G0 phase of the cell cycle. Ki\u201067 positivity gives an estimate of the recent proliferative history of a given cell [49].",

Production of pDC in bone marrow was unchanged over this period, as judged by phenotypic labeling of bone marrow aspirates and Ki\u201067 labeling, suggesting that the loss of pDC from blood at this acute stage was not a consequence of suppressed hematopoiesis [10]. To determine whether the drop in pDC was associated with an increase in pDC in lymph node that would reflect recruitment, we analyzed peripheral lymph node cell suspensions for pDC subsets. Surprisingly, the percentage of live pDC within the lineage\u2212 HLA\u2010DR+ gate decreased fourfold from prior to infection to 14 days post infection [10]. These data suggest that pDC were depleted from both the blood and the lymph nodes during acute SIV infection (Fig. 1A, B).",

Similarly, while the median proportion of pDC that was Ki\u201067+ prior to infection was 51%, this increased to 84% in acutely infected monkeys [10] (Fig. 1). These data reveal that as blood pDC numbers dropped with infection, the fraction of newly produced cells entering the circulation increased [10] (Fig. 2). When we analyzed lymph node pDC for BrdU incorporation after four pulses of BrdU, we found only 2% of pDC were BrdU+ in naive lymph nodes when compared to around 20% in the acutely infected lymph node. The proportion of Ki\u201067+ pDC in lymph node increased from 3% prior to infection to a massive 51% following infection and was inversely correlated with the number of pDC, indicating that recruitment and loss were occurring concurrently [10] (Fig. 1B). Together, these data indicated that underlying the loss of pDC in blood and lymph node was a profound mobilization of pDC from bone marrow into blood and subsequent influx into lymph node (Fig. 2).",

To examine this, we stimulated unseparated lymph node cells taken at day 14 post infection or prior to infection with a TLR7 agonist ex vivo and then measured IFN\u2010\u03b1 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 production in the pDC subset by multicolor flow cytometry. Approximately half of all pDC produced both cytokines in response to this stimulation regardless of infection status, although lymph node pDC from SIV\u2010infected monkeys had a significantly reduced capacity to produce TNF\u2010\u03b1 alone [10].

Nevertheless, the absolute number of pDC in both compartments dropped markedly during this time, associated with widespread pDC activation and apoptosis and infrequent but significant pDC infection [10]. This finding is consistent with several reports showing that HIV induces pDC death both through direct effects and through pDC fusion with virus\u2010infected cells [23, 41, 48] and with the finding that pDC activation in vivo precedes apoptosis [57].

Certainly, other cells including myeloid DC, macrophages, NK cells and activated T cells could contribute to this sustained inflammatory response [54]. Moreover, even if pDC are seen to be the primary producers of type I IFN in lymph nodes during pathogenic SIV and HIV infection, it is still not clear whether IFN is itself detrimental or beneficial in disease or simply a marker of immune activation. Notably, mice receiving chronic administration of TLR7 agonist have pronounced lymph node changes resembling HIV immunopathology, but these effects are independent of IFN [1], suggesting that in this species other cytokines or factors may be central to immune activation.",
