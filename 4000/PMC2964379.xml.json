            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a hepatotropic pathogen that causes liver disease, including fibrosis, cirrhosis, steatosis, insulin resistance, iron overload, and hepatocellular carcinoma. With an estimated 130 million people chronically infected, HCV is a major cause of liver disease worldwide and represents a global healthcare concern. Unfortunately, there is no preventative vaccine to protect against HCV infection, and the available IFN\u2010based standard of care therapy (pegylated IFN\u2010\u03b1 plus ribavirin) is costly, poorly tolerated, associated with significant side effects, and only effective in a fraction of chronically infected individuals. Therefore, as with the other pathogens discussed within this chapter, the need to develop new\u2010generation HCV \u201cantiinfectives\u201d is a healthcare imperative. Although several small molecules that target HCV replication are in the clinical pipeline, the emergence of viral escape mutants indicates that a combination of anti\u2010HCV drugs targeting multiple aspects of infection will likely be required to successfully treat the majority of patients. Thus, this unit aims to facilitate the discovery of HCV antivirals by describing methods to test and evaluate promising antiviral compounds in vitro.",

            "text": "The ability to screen for HCV antivirals that inhibit any aspect of infection was made possible with the 2005 development of the first robust in vitro HCV infection models (Lindenbach et al., 2005; Wakita et al., 2005; Zhong et al., 2005), which recapitulate the entire viral life cycle and allow for HCV propagation in cell culture. This unit focuses on procedures for high\u2010throughput anti\u2010HCV compound screening. Basic Protocol 1 describes the screening of compounds for anti\u2010HCV activity in microtiter plate format using nondividing, synchronized hepatoma cells which allow for reproducible HCV infection in vitro using a low multiplicity of infection approach. Basic Protocol 2 describes a simple mix\u2010and\u2010read FRET\u2010based HCV NS3 protease assay which can be used to assess HCV infection and determine compound efficacy. Because stocks of infectious HCV are required for these basic screening protocols, support protocols detailing the preparation of the necessary HCV stocks are also provided. Support Protocol 1 explains how to generate infectious HCV from in vitro\u2013transcribed HCV RNA, while Support Protocol 2 describes the further amplification of that original HCV stock, and Support Protocol 3 lists methods assessing the infectivity titer of the HCV stocks produced. Together, these protocols encompass several new approaches to compound screening and HCV antiviral drug discovery.",

Unfortunately, this therapy has a wide spectrum of toxic side effects and is only effective in a subset of patients. With the number of HCV patients requiring treatment expected to significantly increase over the next decade (Williams, 2006), there is an obvious and immediate need for new and more effective HCV antivirals.

            "text": "This assay offers several distinct advantages over conventional HCV antiviral compound screening assays. First, while traditional viral HTS assays typically aim to achieve a synchronized single\u2010cycle round of viral replication using a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) approach, this results in biased selection of inhibitors that target viral entry and replication over those compounds that inhibit later viral infection processes such as maturation, egress, and any subsequent cell\u2010to\u2010cell spread. To avoid this predisposition and to identify inhibitors of all aspects of the viral life cycle, the HCV HTS assay described herein is based on a low\u2010MOI 6\u2010day infection during which multiple rounds of HCV infection, and spreading of the virus throughout the culture, occur. As such, inhibitors that target any step of the viral life cycle can be successfully identified. Secondly, to accommodate this long, 6\u2010day infection, this HCV HTS assay makes use of nondividing, synchronized hepatoma cell cultures, which allow for highly reproducible, robust HCVcc infection over an extended period of time, virtually eliminating the well\u2010to\u2010well cell culture\u2013related variability that often plagues cell\u2010based HTS strategies. Additionally, these ready\u2010for\u2010use cultures are easily maintained in and have an inherent tolerability to the common compound library diluent dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). For the average researcher, it is also advantageous that the described HCV FRET assay can be performed with any standard infectious HCV clone (i.e., no special reporters need to be engineered into the viral genome) and makes use of a sensitive commercially available internally quenched NS3 peptide substrate.",

As with all HCV\u2010related cell culture, the use of low\u2010passage Huh7 cells (or at least usage of cells within a defined HCV\u2010permissive cell passage window) is recommended. Additionally, it is imperative that cells be mycoplasma free and greater than 90% viable before use, as HCV infection can be affected by all these variables. Culturing of Huh7 cells in 1% DMSO to induce cell growth arrest involves some additional considerations. First, while this method has proven successful with numerous distinct Huh7 cell lines, it is recommended that each cell line be tested individually to ensure cells behave as expected (e.g., cell growth cessation and liver\u2010specific gene expression enhancement occurring at approximately day 6 post DMSO treatment). One potential problem with DMSO treatment is excess DMSO, which can result in Huh7 cell death and cytotoxicity. When preparing Huh7 cell maintenance medium with 1% (v/v) DMSO, accurately measure all volumes to ensure a final DMSO concentration of 1%. The use of tissue\u2010culture\u2010grade DMSO (Sigma) is recommended. Another potential problem is the overgrowth of Huh7 cells in the presence of 1% DMSO. This can happen when the Huh7 cell maintenance medium with 1% DMSO is initially added to cultures too late, when the cells are already confluent or over\u2010confluent rather than 85% to 90% confluent. The judgement regarding when to add the 1% DMSO\u2013containing medium is subjective, and this should be determined empirically before beginning large\u2010scale experiments with DMSO\u2010treated cultures. Lastly, during the 20\u2010day incubation period, medium must be changed every 2 to 3 days, as Huh7 cells incubated in the presence of 1% DMSO are extremely metabolically active, and thus utilize nutrients at rates significantly faster than their actively dividing counterparts. As such, medium pH quickly becomes acidic, and nutrients are rapidly exhausted, particularly after 6 days of DMSO treatment; medium changes every 2 days are therefore necessary.",

It is highly recommended that in vitro\u2013transcribed RNA be visualized by gel electrophoresis to assess RNA quality, as described (Brown et al., 2004). The presence of a predominant smear of RNAs of different sizes rather than a predominant single band (with slight smear of incomplete products) can indicate incomplete transcription or degradation, which can negatively impact intracellular HCV RNA replication following transfection. The addition of an RNase inhibitor and optimization of transcription reaction incubation period can help ensure that the RNA stock contains a high percent of intact HCV RNA genomes. If RNAs longer than genome length are observed, it may indicate that you have not completely linearized your template DNA and are thus getting continual RNA synthesis around an intact plasmid. This can be resolved by either redigesting the template or by incorporating a step in which the linearized template DNA is separated on an agarose gel before purification. Finally, because contaminants such as proteins or residual phenol, chloroform, or ethanol may reduce transfection efficiency, A\n260/A\n280 spectrophotometric analysis of the in vitro transcribed RNA is recommended to confirm RNA purity.

Thus, the authors advise that Basic Protocol 2 be performed once a sufficient number of sample plates for FRET analysis have been accumulated. This will ensure more consistent FRET results between assay plates, as all fluorescence\u2010related procedures will be performed together and over the course of a few days rather than staggered across several weeks.",

Since cells must incubate for 3 weeks (i.e., 20 days) in the presence of 1% DMSO, batches of plates can be seeded weekly, thus reducing the number of plates to be treated and infected at one time. The aforementioned suggestions, however, are dependent on the number of compounds to be tested and liquid handling equipment available.",
