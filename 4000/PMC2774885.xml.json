Animals and poultry of agricultural importance, including cows, pigs, and chickens, are infected by coronavirus strains that cause respiratory and enteric diseases of varying severity. In 2002\u20132003, SARS\u2010CoV emerged from wildlife to cause an epidemic with a 10% case fatality ratio. Since then, two previously unknown HCoV, NL63 and HKU1, were discovered and found to cause respiratory disease worldwide. New molecular technologies for concurrently screening clinical specimens for a large number of viruses have allowed investigators to associate these newly identified coronaviruses with a wide range of respiratory diseases, from mild upper respiratory tract infections to severe pneumonia. Primary epithelial cell cultures derived from conducting airways have been studied as targets for several respiratory viruses including SARS\u2010CoV. It is also important to understand the role of alveolar epithelial cells in initiating and regulating local immune responses to viral infection in the alveoli through the expression of cytokines and chemokines. Until recently, the responses of alveolar epithelial cells to virus infection were studied in continuous human or animal cell lines derived from the lung. However, these cell lines do not maintain the differentiated phenotypes of alveolar cells and thus, are not optimal models for the highly specialized cell types of the alveolar epithelium. Cell culture techniques that maintain the differentiated phenotypes of primary alveolar epithelial cells permit studies on the virus/host interactions that influence immune responses to alveolar infection. Understanding the molecular details of these interactions will be critical for designing effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of respiratory virus infections.",

Therefore, it is important to study these coronaviruses in differentiated human alveolar epithelial cells in vitro. However, it is desirable to study respiratory coronaviruses for which in vitro studies in differentiated alveolar cells can be correlated with pulmonary infection in vivo. Therefore, we are studying RCoV infection in its natural host as a model for pathogenesis of respiratory coronaviruses. The study of RCoV infection in rats provides an excellent model for understanding the innate immune responses of the alveoli to infection by a respiratory coronavirus of its natural host.",

Ninety\u2010eight percent of the surface area of the alveolar epithelium is made up of AT1 cells, which are large, flattened, nondividing cells that function in gas exchange and fluid homeostasis [\n26\n, \n27\n]. AT1 cells are identified in lung tissue by their morphology, specific binding to Ricinus communis 1 lectin, and expression of T1\u03b1 and aquaporin\u20105 [\n26\n]. AT2 cells are cuboidal, dividing cells and are progenitors for replacement of damaged AT1 cells [\n28\n]. AT2 cells produce surfactant lipids and proteins that keep the alveoli open and contribute to innate defense of the lung [\n29\n]. AT2 cells are distinguished in situ by binding to Maclura pomifera lectin, the presence of lamellar bodies, and expression of SP\u2010A, SP\u2010B, and SP\u2010C [\n26\n, \n29\n]. Infection of alveolar epithelial cells in vivo by respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus, and SARS\u2010CoV, can have significant effects on respiratory functions in the alveoli. Infection of AT1 cells can impair gas exchange and removal of fluid from the lung. In addition, infection of AT2 cells can compromise repair of the damaged alveolar epithelium and innate defense of the alveoli.",

Differences in the cell types that contain viral antigen in different patients may reflect the age of the patient and/or the time after infection when the patient died. Studies on SARS\u2010CoV infection in primate, murine, feline, and ferret models have also demonstrated infection of alveolar epithelial cells. SARS\u2010CoV antigens were detected in AT1 cells of cynomolgus macaques 4 days after inoculation with SARS\u2010CoV, at which time, there was diffuse alveolar damage and neutrophil infiltration in the lung [\n34\n]. van den Brand et al. [\n35\n] found SARS\u2010CoV antigen predominantly in AT1 and AT2 cells of cats and AT2 cells of ferrets 4 days after inoculation with SARS\u2010CoV, when all animals had diffuse alveolar damage with infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages. Although cats had no clinical signs of infection with SARS\u2010CoV, ferrets inoculated with SARS\u2010CoV were lethargic, and one of four ferrets died 4 days after inoculation. In aged mouse and mouse\u2010adapted models of SARS, viral antigens were detected in alveolar epithelial cells without distinguishing AT1 from AT2 cells [\n36\n, \n37\n, \n38\n]. In contrast to inoculation of young mice, inoculation of aged mice with SARS\u2010CoV causes clinical signs of disease, lymphocyte infiltration, and alveolar damage 3\u20139 days after inoculation [\n37\n]. Despite these clinical and histopathological signs of disease, aged mice recover from infection. The mouse\u2010adapted SARS\u2010CoV (MA15) isolated by Roberts et al. [\n36\n] causes lethal infection in BALB/c mice, characterized by viral antigens in bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells with cellular necrosis and infiltration of mononuclear cells. A second mouse\u2010adapted SARS isolate (F\u2010musX\u2010VeroE6) causes clinical signs of disease in BALB/c mice, with a 30% mortality rate [\n38\n]. Inoculation of adult mice with this virus results in viral antigen in alveolar epithelial cells, diffuse alveolar damage, and infiltration of macrophages, lymphocytes, and neutrophils into the alveoli. Porcine respiratory coronavirus antigen has been identified by immunofluorescence in epithelial cells of the alveoli, bronchi, and bronchioli, as well as alveolar macrophages 2\u20136 days after inoculation of infant pigs, resulting in subclinical interstitial pneumonia [\n1\n]. RCoV infection of adult rats results in an influx of neutrophils, followed by lymphocytes and monocytes, into the respiratory tract [\n7\n, \n39\n]. The interactions between respiratory viruses and alveolar epithelial cells can mediate the innate immune response to virus infection in the lung. Primary cultures of differentiated alveolar epithelial cells are a valuable model for studying these interactions.",

Primary AT1 cells are difficult to isolate to a high yield and purity and propagate [\n26\n]. However, AT2 cells can be readily isolated from lung tissue, and under special culture conditions, they maintain their AT2 phenotype. Under different culture conditions, AT2 cells transdifferentiate into an AT1 cell phenotype (\nFig. 1\n). This process of transdifferentiation occurs during repair of the alveolar epithelium in vivo and can be replicated in vitro [\n56\n, \n57\n, \n58\n, \n59\n, \n60\n, \n61\n]. Primary rat AT2 cells maintain their differentiated phenotype when they are cultured on collagen/matrigel in medium containing 5% rat serum and KGF [\n62\n, \n63\n]. The AT2 phenotype is characterized by a cuboidal shape, lipogenesis (evident by the presence of lamellar bodies) and expression of surfactant proteins. When rat AT2 cells are cultured for 3\u20135 days in 10% FBS without KGF, they lose properties of AT2 cells and transdifferentiate into an AT1 cell phenotype (tAT1 cell, also called AT1\u2010like cell) [\n56\n, \n58\n, \n59\n]. These cells are flattened, express markers characteristic of AT1 cells in vivo (T1\u03b1, aquaporin\u20105, and caveolin\u20101), and react with AT1 cell\u2010specific antibodies and lectins [\n26\n, \n59\n, \n64\n, \n65\n, \n66\n, \n67\n, \n68\n]. As the markers used to distinguish AT1 cells in situ are present in tAT1 cells in vitro, tAT1 cells are a practical alternative to AT1 cell isolation for the study of AT1 cells in vitro.

This study was the first to show that virus infection of primary tAT1 cells induces a proinflammatory response. RCoV infection of tAT1 cells induces expression of cytokines, including GM\u2010CSF, IFN\u2010\u03b3, and TNF\u2010\u03b1, and chemokines, predominantly those of the CXC family [\n71\n]. The primary functions of CXC chemokines are to recruit and activate neutrophils. We hypothesize that RCoV infection in the lung induces CXC chemokine expression by AT1 cells, which in turn, recruits neutrophils to the lung. The role of neutrophils during RCoV infection of the lung is unknown, but these cells may contribute to viral clearance and immunopathology. Rat tAT1 cells are a valuable model in which to study the virus/host interactions that regulate this response. Using this model, we showed that like RCoV infection, UV\u2010inactivated RCoV induces CXC chemokine expression in rat tAT1 cells [\n71\n], so virus replication is not required to induce the chemokine response in rat tAT1 cells. Dual immunolabeling of viral antigen and CXC chemokines in rat tAT1 cells showed that CXC chemokines are expressed predominantly from uninfected cells in the culture [\n71\n]. Therefore, expression of CXC chemokines during RCoV infection of tAT1 cells may be mediated by a paracrine mechanism. We found that RCoV\u2010infected rat tAT1 cells treated with IL\u20101Ra had markedly decreased expression of CXC chemokines relative to cells without IL\u20101Ra [\n71\n]. Treatment with soluble TNFR protein did not affect chemokine expression by RCoV\u2010infected tAT1 cells. Thus, signaling through the IL\u20101R likely mediates CXC chemokine expression by rat tAT1 cells during RCoV infection (\nFig. 2\n). As IL\u20101\u03b1 and IL\u20101\u03b2 signal through the IL\u20101R, either or both of these cytokines may contribute to CXC chemokine expression during RCoV infection of tAT1 cells. Manzer et al. [\n65\n, \n82\n] showed that rIL\u20101\u03b1 and rIL\u20101\u03b2 induce expression of CXC chemokines by rat tAT1 cells in vitro.

Neutrophils infiltrate the respiratory tract by 18 h after inoculation of mice with influenza A virus, and increased numbers of neutrophils have been associated with highly pathogenic influenza virus infections in mice [\n87\n, \n88\n]. Depletion of neutrophils from mice exacerbated infection with a highly pathogenic recombinant influenza virus strain containing the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of the 1918 influenza virus [\n87\n]. Thus, neutrophils can play a role in protection from virulent influenza virus infection. In infection with less virulent strains of influenza A virus, neutrophils can have a protective effect [\n89\n, \n90\n] or no effect [\n91\n] on viral replication and pathogenesis.
