Mice derived from this cross are genetically unique, but share 50% of genes with other members of the population. The genetic composition of this stock thus minimizes the chance that findings will apply only to a single inbred or F1 hybrid genotype (15,27). Standard maintenance protocols used for this stock have been described previously (7,11). In brief, mice were weaned at 19\u201321 days of age and maintained in cages containing 3\u20134 mice of the same sex. Nonvirgin (\u201cmated\u201d) female mice were produced by introducing a male mouse into cages containing 3\u20134 female mice when the females were 2 months old. Litters were then removed from these cages within the first week after birth, and the male was removed when the females were 6 months old. Throughout the study, free access to laboratory chow and fresh water was provided, and sentinel animals were exposed to spent bedding on a quarterly basis to check for possible pathogen infection. Three animals were killed following detection of mouse Parvovirus, but no evidence of pinworm, Sendai virus, mycoplasma, or coronavirus was obtained during the study period. All cages were inspected on a daily basis to evaluate the health of the animals and to check for mortalities. Mice found to be extremely ill were killed, and the date of death was recorded as the most likely date of natural death.",

Several predictor variables listed in Table 1 have previously been identified as significantly correlated with mouse life span. Miller (6) showed that, within individual gender categories, variables CD4_8, CD8M_8, CD4V_8, CD4_18, CD4M_18, CD8M_18, CD4V_18, and CD4P_18 were significantly correlated with life span. A later investigation revealed that combining these variables using principal component analysis provided an index with an even stronger association with longevity (7). Miller and colleagues (8) focused on body weight measurements, and found that body weight between the ages of 2 and 24 months was correlated with life span, such that smaller mice were long-lived as compared to larger mice. Harper and colleagues (9) investigated hormone levels as potential predictors of life span, and reported that LEP_4, T4_4, and IGF_15 were correlated with both body weight and life span. Surprisingly, Harper and colleagues (9) also found significantly greater longevity among mice with more advanced cataract formation (higher Cat24 scores). Harper and colleagues (11) confirmed, in a replicate cohort, that CD8M_8, CD8M_8, and CD4_18 were significantly correlated with longevity, and also found that CD8_18 and CD8P_18 were associated with life span. In addition, Harper and colleagues (11) reported that the combination of T-cell subset and body weight measures significantly increased the variation in life span that was explained by regression models, compared to models based only on T-cell or weight predictors individually.",

We eliminated 183 cases in which mice had died prematurely from mouse urinary syndrome or had been removed from colonies because of fighting. Additionally, mice dying within the first 2 years of life were not considered in the analysis. This was done because all predictor variables were recorded within the first 2 years of life, and it was of interest to predict the longevity of mice surviving beyond this 2-year time frame.

Focusing on life-span quartiles therefore allowed us to implement a wider range of machine learning techniques. In addition, predicting categorical outcomes allows success to be measured in terms of an accuracy or error rate, which is useful for judging the performance of algorithms, as well as the quality of predictor variable subsets (20). For virgin males, life-span quartiles were assigned based on a 25th percentile life span of 811 days, a 50th percentile of 890 days, and a 75th percentile of 1034 days. Among virgin females, corresponding 25\u201350\u201375 percentile life spans were 811, 892, and 978 days, respectively. For mated females, these values were 790, 855, and 954 days, respectively.",

All other variables with missing data were continuous. In these cases, we calculated the median value among all observations, added a small amount of random noise, and substituted the obtained value for missing data. Substitution with median values is one of several possible approaches for dealing with missing data (28). The rationale is that variable values further away from the median are more influential in generating predictive models, such that substitution of the median value is neither helpful nor unhelpful for life-prediction.",

The best algorithm depends on the quality of predictor variables and the \u201cdecision boundaries\u201d that best distinguish mice belonging to different life-span quartiles (Figure 1). If quartiles are clearly separated by linear decision boundaries, simple algorithms may predict life-span quartile with high accuracy (see Figure 1A). In contrast, if quartiles can only be separated by complex, irregular decision boundaries, accurate prediction of life-span quartile will require more sophisticated algorithms (see Figure 1B). We therefore applied many algorithms to determine which approaches provide the best results for prediction of life-span quartile (Table 2). The manner by which algorithms generated predictions varied considerably among the different methods. Some algorithms generated predictions by constructing regression models (simple linear regression, multinomial logistic regression), whereas others constructed decision trees or sets of classification rules (e.g., binary decision trees, random forest, Ripper rule learner). Other algorithms fit probability models to mice associated with each life-span quartile, and used posterior class probability as a basis for prediction (e.g., naive Bayes). In some cases, predictions were generated in nonparametric fashion without construction of a formal classification model (e.g., k-nearest neighbor, nearest centroid, nearest shrunken centroid [NSC]). All algorithms were implemented using the R statistical software package. Specific functions of the R extension package used to implement each algorithm are listed in Table 2, and full descriptions of each package and function can be accessed online (http://www.r-project.org/).",

This can be done, for example, by constructing an overfit regression model with a large number of parameters. The predictive performance of such a model, however, would be sensitive to chance variation or noise in the training samples chosen to construct the model. Consequently, the model would lack \u201cgeneralization ability\u201d and would not be useful as a prognostic tool (20). The ability of an algorithm to produce generalizable results can be tested by using cross-validation to evaluate prediction accuracy, a process in which the model is trained by using one set of data, and its prediction accuracy evaluated by using a another, distinct set of data. This evaluation procedure is commonly used in the development of predictive models, and is necessary for providing a realistic assessment of how useful a model can be in practical scenarios in which the interest is to forecast results based on predictor variables from new observations (e.g., partially complete survivorship studies). Our analysis therefore used cross-validation to evaluate the accuracy of each algorithm for prediction of life-span quartile. Approximately 90% of the 741 mice were randomly selected as \u201ctraining data,\u201d with the remaining 10% of mice serving as \u201ctesting data.\u201d Machine learning models were constructed using only the training data, and the resulting model was then applied to the testing data to determine prediction accuracy. The process of randomly parsing observations into training and testing sets, training the algorithm, and applying the algorithm to test data was repeated 10,000 times for each algorithm evaluated. Training data sets were always constructed such that an equal number of cases from each life-span quartile were presented to the algorithm. Testing data sets contained approximately 20 cases from each life-span quartile. The average prediction accuracy attained by each algorithm was compared to that expected from random guessing (25%). A 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each average prediction accuracy and was used to evaluate whether accuracy was significantly >25% or whether performance differed significantly among alternative algorithms.",

For each algorithm, models were generated using all 31 predictor variables, as well as subsets of 12 and 6 predictor variables that were chosen by ranking variables according to their importance to prediction accuracy based on the Random Forest algorithm (33) (see Figure 3). This algorithm generates a useful measure of variable importance based on cross-validation and the accuracy decline that results when predictors are removed from the data set (44). We used this measure to rank all 31 predictor variables in terms of their importance for predicting life-span quartile (Figure 3). This approach suggested that the subset CD4V_18 and body weight measurements were the most important variables for life-span quartile prediction, whereas some variables, such as T4_4, T4_15, and LEP_15, may have a net deleterious effect on prediction accuracy. These results were supported by our evaluation of algorithm performance (Table 2), because most algorithms performed best when only the 12 or 6 most important predictors were used (Table 2). For instance, using all 31 predictor variables, SVM predicted life-span quartile with 29.90% accuracy, but this value increased to 34.03% when only the best 12 predictor variables were used.",

The second best two-variable subset provided 33.4% accuracy and also included CD4V_18, but in combination with another T-cell measure (CD8M_8) rather than a body weight variable. We next evaluated each of the 31C3 = 4495 three-variable subsets (using at least 20 simulations per subset) and found that best performance was attained with CD4V_18, W8, and W18 as predictors (34.4%). Taken together, these results suggested that the best four-variable subset would include CD4V_18. We thus evaluated the 30C3 = 4060 possible four-variable subsets that include CD4V_18 and found that a subset of CD4V_18, W8, W10, and W18 yielded an accuracy of 34.6%. Continuing in this fashion, we examined the 29C3 = 3654 possible five-variable subsets that include CD4V_18 and W18. This analysis suggested a five-variable model with three body weight variables (W8, W10, and W18) and two T-cell subset variables (CD4V_18 and CD4M_8), which yielded an accuracy of 35.3% (95% CI, 35.2%-35.4%).

Full-length survivorship experiments require years to complete and are a rate-limiting step in the study of mammalian aging. Clearly, such experiments will never be replaced by predictive models. Well-developed models, however, can generate preliminary data years in advance, and the output of such models, as an integration of multiple variables that may predict life span individually, can provide a surrogate target for aging research that is easier to evaluate than life span. Indeed, a similar concept has already been successfully applied using the Drosophila model system (45). Using gene expression patterns that predict life span, Baur and colleagues (45) developed a survivorship screen that satisfactorily revealed the known effects of temperature, caloric restriction, and resveratrol on Drosophila life span, but required 80% less time than a full-length survivorship study. We have here explored the plausibility of such a model in mice, and our results provide a realistic indication of how accurately mouse life span can be predicted using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Using a set of physiological measurements made prior to 24 months of age, we have shown that mouse life-span quartile can be predicted with an average accuracy of 35.3%. This estimate is based on a stringent cross-validation criterion, in which accuracy is based on prediction of test cases not used in model construction. We suggest that considerable potential remains for improving on the 35.3% prediction accuracy attained in this study.

We have carried out a performance evaluation of many machine learning approaches for the specific task of predicting mouse life span, which provides guidance for future studies addressing this issue. It should be borne in mind that, for any algorithm, performance is data-dependent and will vary across contexts. It is therefore impossible and incorrect to identify a single \u201cbest algorithm\u201d that will always yield the best predictive performance (20). We anticipate, however, that any survivorship data set containing life-span-predictor variables will share some properties with data analyzed here. For instance, some level of \u201coverlap\u201d between mice belonging to different life-span quartiles seems inevitable, such that accurate predictions will require recognition of complex decision boundaries (see Figures 1 and 2). The best algorithms identified in our analysis were most successful at characterizing such decision boundaries, and therefore provide good starting points for future investigations aimed at prediction of mouse life span. We found that life span was accurately predicted by SVM and SLDA algorithms, but that the NSC approach provided the best overall performance. This algorithm was developed in the context of DNA microarray data sets and was used to classify cancer subtypes based on gene expression patterns (29). The approach is also straightforward to implement and can be understood by nonexperts. It is computationally inexpensive, as 10,000 simulations can be carried out in <1 hour on a standard desktop PC; other algorithms listed in Table 2 required as much as 2 days for execution using the same hardware. The method is similar to the Nearest Centroid approach, which uses p predictor variables to obtain a p-dimensional centroid for each life-span quartile, and predicts life-span quartile for new cases by determining which centroid the test case is most similar to. In the NSC approach, however, class centroids are standardized and \u201cshrunk\u201d toward an overall centroid (calculated by averaging centroids among life-span quartiles), which has the effect of emphasizing those predictors with low levels of variation in each class (see 29). This yields a classification rule characterized by complex, nonlinear decision boundaries, which has been found to perform well on challenging machine learning tasks (29,46).",

Numerous sources of variation obscure relationships that exist between life-span quartile and the predictor variables we measured. To deal with this variation, effective algorithms must accurately characterize underlying biological relationships, and must do this consistently despite \u201cnoise\u201d that obscures underlying relationships. In other words, for accurate prediction, decision boundaries chosen by algorithms should be unbiased but, at the same time, must be robust to noise and chance variation within training data. In general, these aspects of predictive modeling are in tension but, by increasing the number of training samples for algorithm learning, it is often possible to decrease both the bias and variance associated with decision boundaries (20). Our study evaluated models based on 664 training samples, which is small compared to training set sizes commonly used for machine learning tasks. In the context of handwritten digit recognition, for instance, benchmark tasks commonly include more than 50,000 training samples (21,47). We therefore expect that the generation of larger data sets would lead to further improvements in life-span prediction accuracy. We achieved 35.3% prediction accuracy using 664 training samples, but our analyses indicate that 1000 training samples would yield an accuracy of approximately 40% (Figure 8) with the same, limited set of predictors. This finding suggests that a survivorship experiment generating 1000 mice (living beyond 2 years of age) would provide a more useful model than that developed in this study.

            "text": "The successful prediction of mouse life span ultimately depends on the quality of predictor variables that are available. Predictor variables, or some multivariate combination of predictors, must have a linear or nonlinear association with life span. Otherwise, a useful model cannot be constructed, regardless of the computational approach that is taken. The basis of associations between predictors and life span is of special interest. Predictor variables can be associated with life span through a specific disease process. For example, if leukemia is a major factor contributing to mortality in a cohort, blood cell counts may provide an effective predictor of longevity, and the overall predictive model will be uninformative with regard to aging mechanisms. Alternatively, predictor variables can be associated with life span because they characterize some aspect of the aging process. We found, for example, that body weight measurements between 8 and 18 months of age were among the most important predictors of life-span quartile, and that four of the top five predictors were body weight variables. These results are consistent with our findings from earlier studies (8,11), as well as from multiple investigations showing that, within individual species, lower body weight is commonly associated with increased longevity (48\u201350). Links between body weight, aging, and longevity are not fully understood, but the GH/IGF-I axis may be an underlying explanatory factor (12). In fact, we found that, among mice living beyond 2 years of age, body weight values were correlated with serum IGF-I levels at 4 and 15 months of age (0.42 < r < 0.46). In some segregating mouse populations, low IGF-I levels early in life do indeed predict longer life span (51).",

            "text": "Identification of new phenotypic traits that predict life span may be the most promising approach for improving on our results. We examined 31 predictor variables, but life span was most accurately forecasted when only the five strongest predictors were used in model construction. The strongest predictors in our current data set are drawn from two physiological domains, body weight and T-cell biology, and there are strong correlations among the various body weight measures as well as among the T-cell subset frequencies. Including several measures of weight, or several measures of T-cell status, may improve the performance of these predictive algorithms by diminishing the variation reflecting measurement error or day-to-day variations in biological state that are independent of inter-individual differences (for example, the effects of a recent meal or hydration state on measured body weight). We suspect that incorporation of measures drawn from other physiological domains, such as tests of motor function, cognitive function, or resistance to DNA damage, might be a useful step toward improved predictive performance. Previous studies, for example, have identified other noninvasive phenotypic traits (correlated with life span) that were not evaluated in our study. Harrison and Archer (2), for example, showed that tight wire clinging ability, open field activity, collagen denaturation rate, hair regrowth, wound healing, and blood hemoglobin concentration were all correlated with longevity in certain mouse genotypes. Flurkey and colleagues (15) described several other potentially useful phenotypic traits, such as urine concentrating ability and carbon dioxide production, for which relationships with longevity have not been examined. A nearly endless list of possible predictor variables is provided by expression measures of individual genes or composite measures derived from a number of genes. In skin tissue, for instance, p16INK4A has been found to correlate with chronological age, although its value as a predictor of longevity has not been previously considered (52,53). Some gene expression variables may reflect certain physiological states beneficial for longevity, and may therefore prove to be unexpectedly valuable longevity predictors, even when population-level variation is attributable to nongenetic or \u201cchance\u201d sources in uniform environments [e.g., (54)]. For genetically heterogeneous populations, such as that considered in the present study, genetic polymorphisms represent an especially important avenue for investigation. Various forms of genetic data, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, could readily be incorporated into models as categorical predictor variables, which may improve prediction accuracy by accounting for interactions between genotypic and phenotypic characters. Such interactions may be of considerable importance, as Harrison and Archer (2) found that relationships between phenotypic traits and longevity were often dependent on genotype.",

Aging biomarkers provide an operational definition of aging that is useful for testing hypotheses about aging experimentally, such as whether aging is delayed by mutations or environmental interventions (15). The denaturation rate of collagen, for example, has been used as a biomarker to suggest that aging is delayed in long-lived mouse strains (55). The quest for aging biomarkers has been controversial, and hindered by both conceptual and methodological hurdles, including disagreement regarding the definition of \u201cbiomarker,\u201d overlap between aging and disease processes, and lack of knowledge about aging mechanisms (56\u201359). For example, there is an important conceptual distinction between predictors of life span and biomarkers of aging. To be useful as a biomarker of aging, a measurement must be able to distinguish among individuals who are aging at different rates\u2014for example, because of differential exposure to a putative anti-aging intervention. Conceptually, such traits must be measured in individuals who have already experienced some effects of the aging process\u2014for example, middle-aged adults. Inherited alleles, or weight at birth, for example, may prove to be a strong predictor of life span or of other age-related end points, and yet have no value as a measure of the rate at which aging has occurred in a specific individual.",

The cross-validation strategy used in the present study, involving random division of data into training and testing sets, provides a useful way of evaluating predictive capacity and thus provides a framework for biomarker validation. Furthermore, we have used machine learning to generate posterior class probabilities for different life-span quartiles (see Figure 7). Such posterior probabilities may provide useful indices that serve as biomarkers or as indicators of \u201cbiological age\u201d (64\u201366). A key advantage of this approach is that alternative models used to generate posterior probabilities can be compared based on cross-validation life-span prediction accuracy. This could make progress stemming from the biomarker research agenda more transparent from skeptical viewpoints because, for example, it would be unambiguous to determine whether an index generated by predictors X, Y, and Z is superior to an index generated by predictors P, Q, and S.",

At a glance, this 5.8% difference seems minor. It should be noted, however, that an algorithm predicting death from cancer in the American population (with 100% accuracy) would separate humans into groups differing by <3% in mean life span (67). We therefore suggest that our model provides informative predictions with biologically meaningful underpinnings. Furthermore, we are optimistic that more accurate life-span-predictive models can be formulated in future investigations. The computational approach that performed best in our analysis was developed within the last decade (29). In the coming decade, intensive research efforts will focus on improving variable selection methods (68), extracting informative features from a set of variables (69), developing ensemble approaches for combining outputs of multiple algorithms (70), and filtering training samples to identify maximally informative cases for learning (71). Such investigations will lay the groundwork for development of new algorithms, which can be complemented by better understanding of aging mechanisms and exploitation of life span predictors at the molecular and phenotypic levels. These approaches, both computational and biological, can improve the accuracy with which mouse life span is predicted, and should advance interdisciplinary approaches to biogerontology and the study of mammalian aging.",
