Respiratory samples included throat swabs, nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, scraped NP epithelial cells, and nasal washes and were either archived or collected prospectively specifically for this study. Inclusion criteria for children with acute KD were >5 days of fever plus at least 4 of 5 standard clinical criteria (rash, conjunctival injection, cervical lymphadenopathy, changes in the extremities, and changes in lips or oral mucosa) [14] or 3 of 5 criteria with dilated coronary arteries by echocardiogram (z score > 2.5) [15].

Scraped NP epithelial cells were obtained with a Rhinoprobe curette (Arlington Scientific). Cells were eluted into viral transport medium and either were processed directly for RNA isolation or were washed twice in PBS, collected by centrifugation, and stored at \u221270\u00b0C until RNA extraction. Nasal washes were performed by forceful instillation of 2 mL of sterile saline (0.9% NaCl) into a nostril by use of a syringe and subsequent aspiration of the same nostril to obtain a deep NP sample. All but 2 samples were stored at \u221270\u00b0C in TRIzol reagent until RNA was extracted; the remaining 2 samples were stored for 1\u20132 weeks at 4\u00b0C before RNA extraction. Five centers (University of California, San Diego [UCSD], La Jolla, California; Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee; Loyola University, Maywood, Illinois; Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois; and the AMC) extracted RNA from the samples and either (1) synthesized cDNA followed by PCR or nested PCR and analysis by ethidium-bromide\u2013stained gel or (2) performed quantitative PCR using either a TaqMan probe or SYBR Green fluorescence (Applied Biosystems). Fifteen different primer (and probe) sets had binding sites located in the HCoV-NL63 nucleocapsid protein gene (primer sets A\u2013C [13], N, O, and R), HCoV-NL63 ORF1b (primer sets D\u2013F and M and primer set P with nested primer set Q [12]), HCoV-NH ORF1a (primer set J [10]), and the HCoV-NH spike glycoprotein gene (primer set K with nested primer set L [10]). Three additional degenerate primer sets (G\u2013I) were designed on the basis of conserved regions of the RNA polymerase and helicase in ORF1b, which are shared by HCoV-NL63, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2013CoV (GenBank accession number NC_004718), HCoV-E229 (GenBank accession number NC_002645), and HCoV-OC43 (GenBank accession number NC_005147). For details on assay conditions, reagents, and primer sequences, see Appendix A, in the electronic edition Appendix A, which is not provided in the print edition (letter code for primer pairs refers to the list in Appendix A). All samples were also tested using primers and probes for either human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Applied Biosystems), porphobilinogen deaminase (primer/probe set T), or \u03b2-2-microglobulin (primer set U [16]), to check the quality and quantity of extracted RNA. Each RT-PCR included appropriate positive and negative controls. Positive control templates for HCoV-NL63 PCR were either clinical isolates of HCoV-NL63 RNA [13] (gift from Ron Fouchier, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) or Topo-NL63 nucleocapsid protein gene plasmid (gift from Ralph Baric, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill). The positive control template for the degenerate CoV PCR assays was cDNA from SARS-CoV (gift from Michael Buchmeier and Benjamin Neuman, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California). The sensitivity of the PCR assays was assessed by testing 10-fold serial dilutions of known quantities of either RNA derived from HCoV-NL63 culture supernatants, Topo-NL63 nucleocapsid protein gene plasmid, or PCR products from each primer set",

To ensure detection of either virus, degenerate primers were designed (primer sets G\u2013I), and 2 of the primer sets (primer set J and primer set K with nested primer set L) used in our study were identical to the primer sets used to detect HCoV-NH by Esper et al. [10]. The single positive HCoV-NL63 molecular isolate from a patient with acute KD yielded an amplification product with all primers tested, including the HCoV-NH ORF1a primers from Esper et al., making it unlikely that we missed HCoV-NH because of sequence divergence from HCoV-NL63. In all, 12 throat swabs, 2 scraped NP epithelial cell samples, and 1 NP swab were tested using the HCoV-NH ORF1a primers, and 12 throat swabs and 2 scraped NP epithelial cell samples were tested using the HCoV-NH spike glycoprotein primers [10]",

[10]. First, the Esper study included only frozen, archived nasal washes from New Haven, Connecticut, and 6 of 8 samples positive by RT-PCR were collected from January to April of 2004 (F. Esper, personal communication). This suggests the possibility of a CoV outbreak in New Haven that could have caused coincidental infection in children with KD. Arguing against this possibility is that control children sampled within 2 weeks of the patients with KD did not show a similarly high rate of HCoV detection",

Only 20 patients in the present study had an NP sample of some type tested, and the single positive sample was from 1 of only 7 NP swabs. It is possible that sample collection methods affect the rate of detection of HCoV-NL63. In Canada, HCoV-NL63 was detected in 6 (6.5%) of 92 NP swabs versus 8 (2.8%) of 284 throat or pharyngeal swabs collected from patients with acute respiratory tract infections [18]. However, in the case of SARS-CoV, rates of viral detection by RT-PCR did not differ significantly among NP swabs, throat swabs, and NP aspirates [17]. SARS-CoV was detected in 15 (26%) of 58 NP swabs, 13 (30%) of 43 throat swabs, and 60 (31%) of 192 NP aspirates collected during the first 4 weeks of illness",

We amplified HCoV-NL63 using 13 different sets of primers with TaqMan PCR, SYBR Green PCR, and conventional PCR, with a sensitivity of 1\u2013100 copies.

Esper et al. detected HCoV-NH in 79 (8.8%) of 895 children with respiratory symptoms who were negative for RSV, influenza viruses A and B, human parainfluenza viruses 1\u20133, and adenovirus by DFA [11]. The detection rate for HCoV-NL63 was highest in children <5 years of age [18], which coincides with the peak age group for KD. Thus, coexisting HCoV-NL63 infection in children with KD may occur, especially during winter. A wide variety of respiratory viruses have been occasionally isolated from patients with KD [8, 20, 21]. The one patient with KD in the present study who was positive for HCoV-NL63 had prominent respiratory symptoms not characteristic of KD, including copious rhinorrhea and cough. Therefore, this patient had coexisting, symptomatic HCoV-NL63 upper respiratory tract infection",
