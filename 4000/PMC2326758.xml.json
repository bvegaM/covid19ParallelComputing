            "text": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) collectively designates corona viruses of a wide range of virulence. The strains that are endemic in most mouse colonies over the world show relatively low virulence and animals from infected colonies do not present overt signs of illness. Nevertheless, although tolerated by many researchers, evidence has accumulated over the years that results from several investigation areas can be compromised by concomitant MHV infections. In particular, the study of immunological parameters that determine resistance to infections can be seriously affected by MHV infection (reviewed in refs 1,2). There are few studies on the effects of infection by natural-low-virulence enzootic MHV strains on immune responses and on their interference with experimental models of infection. Most reports deal with virulent laboratory strains, although more recently, attenuated MHV laboratory strains have been used in an attempt to mimic the prevalent strains.2 The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of a natural acute outbreak of MHV due to accidental exposure, in our otherwise specific-pathogen-free (SPF) inbred mouse colonies, and of enzootic chronic MHV infection on cytokine production and resistance to the intracellular pathogen Trypanosoma cruzi.",

            "text": "Trypanosoma cruzi is a dygenetic protozoan that infects several kinds of mammals and is the aetiological agent of Chagas\u2019 disease in man.3 The parasite replicates in the cytoplasm of virtually any nucleated cell type including macrophages; non-dividing forms of the parasite are found free in the blood. Efficient control of parasite load and host survival rely on T-cell-mediated immunity via T-helper cell-dependent protective antibody responses and macrophage activation for intracellular killing of the protozoan; major histocompatibility complex class I-dependent effector mechanisms also contribute to parasitism control (reviewed in refs 4,5). Among inbred mouse strains, C3H, A/J and BALB/c mice rank as susceptible to most parasite strains whereas C57BL/6 and SJL mice are more resistant.6 Susceptible mice have higher parasite numbers in the blood and tissues and most animals die within 6 weeks of inoculation of as few as 50 parasites; in contrast, resistant mice have lower parasite loads and survive infection with 50 000 parasites.7 Both T. cruzi-resistant and -susceptible mouse strains show elevated production of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) during infection8 and very low interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-4 production.8\u201311 IFN-\u03b3 and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), triggered by IL-12, are essential to control of parasitism by innate and acquired cellular immune systems in mice.12\u201314 IL-10 exerts an important in vivo regulatory role on IFN-\u03b3 and nitric oxide production12,15 and its absence in IL-10-gene-deprived mice12,16 or neutralization by monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment17 results in lower parasitism, whereas increased parasitism occurs when mice are treated with recombinant IL-10 (rIL-10)12 or receive IL-10- and IL-4-producing T cells.15 IL-4, depending on the parasite strain, is also involved in negative regulation of parasitism.18",

Mice with negative serological tests for MHV, from both these strains, were obtained from Biot\u00e9rio de Camundongos Isog\u00eanicos da Universidade Estadual de Campinas (Campinas, SP, Brazil). MHV\u2212 mice were housed and handled separate from and before those coming from MHV-contaminated animal facilities. The mice were fed autoclaved food and water, and were handled using disposable gloves. MHV infection was diagnosed by antibody testing of the sera. The MHV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) diagnostic kits sold by Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) were used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. When the outbreak of MHV was detected, levels of anti-MHV antibodies were very high with corrected optical density (OD) values for sera ranging from 8\u00b75 to 23\u00b78 (positive test values >3). These were calculated (as indicated by the manufacturer) by the following formula: [(OD obtained for the test serum diluted at 1/50 incubated with the cells containing the virus) \u2013 (OD obtained for the same serum and dilution incubated with uninfected cells)]/0\u00b713. Fluorescence antibody testing was also performed as an additional control and ranked + + + + for serum incubated with MHV-infected cells.

Recipients of inocula from MHV\u2212 mice remained serologically negative for MHV. Looking into possible causes of the observed increase in susceptibility to T. cruzi of mice infected with MHV+-derived inocula. we investigated whether cytokine production was altered concomitant to the viral infection. Spleen cells (stimulated with Con A or T-Ag) from mice that received an MHV+ inoculum of 500 T. cruzi produced detectable and much higher levels of IL-10 during the first 3 weeks of infection than spleen cells from mice that received an identical inoculum of T. cruzi derived from MHV\u2212 mice. In fact, IL-10 production in this last situation was very low and often below 3\u00b712 units/ml (Table 1). IL-10 production, on day 11 after infection, in BALB/c (but not in C57BL/6) mice was CD4-activation dependent as treatment with GK1.5 mAb suppressed most of its synthesis (63 units/ml in untreated versus 6 units/ml in GK1.5 treated cultures in Con A-stimulated and 22 units/ml versus 6 units/ml, respectively, in T-Ag-stimulated BALB/c spleen cell cultures). In C57BL/6 mice, the values were 14 units/ml in untreated versus 10 units/ml in GK1.5-treated Con A-stimulated cultures and 13 versus 10 units/ml, respectively, after T-Ag stimulation. In spite of the higher IL-10 production by spleen cells from mice that had received the MHV+ inoculum, IFN-\u03b3 levels were not significantly different from those secreted by spleen cells from MHV\u2212T. cruzi recipients and IL-4 production was below detection levels in all groups (data not shown).",

BALB/c mice spleen cell cultures from MHV+ mice infected with T. cruzi produced lower IFN-\u03b3 levels to Con A and T-Ag stimulation than cultures from MHV\u2212 mice (Fig. 3). Although the potential to produce IFN-\u03b3 to polyclonal Con A stimulation was preserved in MHV+C57BL/6 mice, IFN-\u03b3 production was markedly suppressed on parasite-specific stimulation (Fig. 4). The comparison of IL-10 production levels among BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, MHV\u2212 or MHV+, infected with T. cruzi yielded no significant differences (data not shown). Nevertheless, when BALB/c (but not C57BL/6) spleen cell cultures stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 (an antigen-presenting-cell-independent polyclonal T-cell activator) were treated with neutralizing anti-IFN-\u03b3 antibody, increased production of IL-10 was observed in cultures derived from MHV+ mice but not from MHV\u2212 mice (Fig. 5). Augmentation of IL-10 production was observed in cultures from T.cruzi-infected MHV+ mice and also in cultures from T. cruzi-uninfected MHV+ mice (Fig. 5, normal group), suggesting that the potential to increased IL-10 production stimulated by MHV infection was, in these mice, maintained in check by IFN-\u03b3. Taken together, these results indicate that in C57BL/6 mice, suppression of IFN-\u03b3 responses is limited to the antigen-specific compartment whereas MHV infection affects more severely BALB/c mice by suppression of both polyclonal and specific IFN-\u03b3 responses.",

The difficulty in isolating low virulence enzootic enterotropic MHV, as opposed to polytropic laboratory MHV strains, has been frequently reported.1,2,20 We had (as many other authors) to rely on serum antibody screening and serological conversion as a criterion to identify occurrence of MHV infection. Serological testing, although highly specific, does not distinguish between acute and chronic MHV infection and thus we will discuss the immunological alterations found in the group of mice that had recently become seropositive for MHV (recent MHV-testers) in comparison with those found in mice originating from colonies with longstanding record of MHV seropositivity. Both groups of mice were serologically negative on testing for several other mouse pathogenic viruses and for Mycoplasma pulmonis (see the Materials and Methods).",

In this regard, C57BL/6 mice are semisusceptible to most MHV strains;1,2 as production of IL-10 by MHV-infected C57BL/6 mice (but not by BALB/c mice) was CD4+-activation independent, virus-infected or virus-stimulated macrophages could be the main source of this cytokine.",

However, established \u2018chronic\u2019 natural infection with MHV was reported to affect mostly splenic T lymphocytes, with a 20\u201350% decrease in proliferative responses to Con A and resistance to the effects of nor-adrenalin or dibutyryl-cAMP.34 We found that lymphoproliferative responses of spleen cells from BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, MHV+ or MHV\u2212 recipient mice to Con A, T-Ag, or anti-CD3 stimulation were not significantly different. Suppressed lymphoproliferative responses to these stimuli, commonly seen in the course of T. cruzi infection,11 were observed from day 11 of infection, with minimal levels of suppression seen on day 19 and recovery by day 27 (data not shown). Thus, in the course of T. cruzi infection, we did not observe, neither in recently seropositive recipient mice nor in mice from chronically MHV-infected colonies, suppression of lymphoproliferation to Con A, to parasite antigens or to anti-CD3 stimulation that could be ascribed to the viral infection. However, its occurrence could have been masked by the intense suppression characteristic of acute T. cruzi infection.",

            "text": "We further investigated the influence of a longstanding (1 year) established endemic MHV infection on the course of T. cruzi infection and immune response. In contrast with the marked effects on the immune response observed in MHV\u2212 hosts infected with T. cruzi derived from recently MHV+ mice, the disturbances of immune response found in mice from chronically MHV-infected colonies were milder. Production of IL-10 was similar between MHV+ and MHV\u2212 mice, while parasite\u2013antigen-stimulated IFN-\u03b3 production was lower in T. cruzi-infected BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. However, when neutralization of IFN-\u03b3 in the cultures unmasked the full potential of IL-10 secretion, MHV+ BALB/c mice (but not C57BL/6), showed higher IL-10 production levels. This result is consistent with the trend of enhanced T. cruzi susceptibility observed in MHV+ BALB/c mice that resulted in earlier and higher blood parasitaemia levels. Taken together, these data indicate that several alterations of the immune response occur because of chronic MHV infection. Although milder than those observed in the recent infection situation, it is worth mentioning that MHV-infected mouse colonies are subject to recurrent subacute, subclinical infections by mutant MHV strains with unpredictable consequences for the immune response.",
