That meningitis could be caused by other ''filterable agents' ' (i.e., viruses) was demonstrated by Rivers and Scot, who in 1935 recovered lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus from the CSF of an affected patient. It is now known that a wide variety of viral agents may invade the central nervous system to produce meningitis or encephalitis.",

First, viral meningitis must be differentiated from the much more dangerous condition, bacterial meningitis: Until this is accomplished, patients presenting with signs and symptoms of meningitis must be considered medical emergencies, and antibiotic treatment for presumptive meningitis must be instituted if there is serious question of bacterial rather than viral infection. Second, viral meningitis, although rarely fatal, may produce clinical impairment that may persist from weeks to months. Finally, ''lymphocytic'' or ''aseptic'' meningitis may be caused by agents other than viruses, and the possibility of other, more readily treated (and sometimes more dangerous) conditions must be kept in mind when diagnosing a patient with presumed viral meningitis.",

            "text": "Before meningitis can occur, the causative agent must first penetrate the body from the external environment and then gain entry to the nervous system across the blood-brain barrier. Initial entry of the virus into the host may occur by gastrointestinal inoculation (as is the case with the enteroviruses), cutaneous inoculation (as occurs with the arthropodborne agents), the respiratory route (as is the case with mumps), or transmucosal penetration or intravenous inoculation (as occurs with HIV). Early workers in the field of viral central nervous system (CNS) infections believed that invasion of the nervous system occurred by spread of viruses within neurons. Currently, however, it is known that the majority of viral meningitides result from hematogenous dissemination of virus following symptomatic or clinically inapparent systemic infection. Penetration across the blood-brain barrier may occur at the choroid plexus or through meningeal capillaries. Exceptions to this are unusual but include meningitis following genital herpes simplex infection, meningitis associated with herpes zoster, and Mollaret's meningitis, in which reactivated infection of herpes simplex virus type 2 within dorsal root ganglia leads to repeated episodes of meningitis. Replication of viruses in cells of the meninges, superficial brain or spinal cord parenchyma, and the ventricular system elicits an inflammatory response, which is predominantly lymphocytic, and results in alteration of the blood-brain barrier so that protein levels increase within CSF. Unlike bacteria or fungi, however, replication of viruses does not consume glucose within CSF, nor does it usually result in altered transport of glucose across the blood-brain barrier. Thus, in contrast to bacterial, mycobacterial, or fungal infections, CSF glucose concentrations in viral meningitis are usually normal.",

Older data suggest that herpes simplex virus type 2 accounts for 2 or 3% of cases of viral meningitis. Recent work employing polymerase chain reaction methods suggests that it may be the most common cause of viral meningitis in adult women.

Occasional cases may also follow primary genital infection with herpes simplex virus type 1; nonprimary genital infection with either serotype only rarely causes disease.

LCMV is associated with human cases of meningoencephalitis as a consequence of exposure to laboratory or wild mice and in rare epidemics it is associated with pet hamsters. Cases tend to be more common under conditions of impoverished living and poor hygiene. Only approximately 15% of infected individuals develop meningitis. LCMV meningitis typically occurs during autumn and early winter, and it has been suggested that this reflects more extensive mouse-human contact as mice move inside to escape winter weather. In studies prior to 1960, the virus was thought to account for 9-11% of cases of viral meningitis. In recent years, reports of meningitis due to LCMV have been rare. However, congenital LCMV infection is a significant, often unrecognized cause of chorioretinitis, hydrocephalus, microcephaly or macrocephaly, and mental retardation. Acquired LCMV infection likewise may be an underappreciated illness. The meningitis caused by LCMV may be extremely persistent and has been associated with symptoms and CSF abnormalities lasting months. Acquired LCMV infection may also be associated with encephalitis, transverse myelitis, a Guillain-Barr\u00e9-type syndrome, and both transient and permanent acquired hydrocephalus.",

At the cellular level, defective cellular copper export causes trapping of copper in some cell types (e.g., intestinal mucosa and kidney tubule), leading to systemic copper insufficiency and failure of copper delivery to tissues such as the central nervous system. The disorder was recently shown to be due to mutations in a gene encoding a copper-transporting P-type ATPase, ATP7A or MNK.
