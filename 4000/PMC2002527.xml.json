The pandemic might have resulted indirectly from the dislocation and migration associated with the First World War but it was far more deadly: as many as 40 million people died within 18 months. Around 25% of the world's 1.8 billion population was affected, indicating a mortality rate of nearly 10%. Ever since, the severity of the Spanish flu has fuelled fears of a recurrence and many researchers believe that it is only a matter of time before the next pandemic strikes. \u201cWe can be pretty certain that the probability of another flu pandemic is 100%, though we cannot say when exactly,\u201d said William Hanage, research associate in the Divison of Epidemiology at Imperial College, London, UK.",

Ebola virus is highly virulent but requires direct contact with fluids or secretions from infected people. Malaria is most commonly transmitted by the female Anopheles mosquito and is therefore largely confined to areas where this mosquito lives. AIDS has already killed as many people as the 1918 Spanish flu, but over a longer time-period because the transmission of HIV requires direct contact with bodily fluids. Although it poses a huge health problem and has no known cure, HIV/AIDS does not qualify as a pandemic because it cannot spread quickly and individuals can largely protect themselves through appropriate precautions.\u2026an infectious agent must have several properties to be able to cause a pandemic: it must be able to spread rapidly from person to person; it must be infectious and virulent; and it must have a significantly high mortality rate",

The virus is also able to infect other species including humans, in whom it has a mortality rate as high as 60%.

However, some bacterial strains produce lethal toxins that kill the host even after the infection has cleared\u2014such is the case with tetanus, which is caused by a neurotoxin released by Clostridium tetani. In other cases, as Hanage noted, bacteria can enter the bloodstream and survive, causing illness and death indirectly through acute sepsis, when a cytokine storm triggers a massive and potentially lethal inflammatory response.\u2026as there are no known means of controlling such agents, infectious proteins could be regarded as a potential pandemic threat",

First, the virus might kill so many cells that organs and critical metabolic processes fail\u2014one of the hallmarks of Ebola virus, for example. Second, patients might die as a result of their cytokine response, as did many younger victims of the Spanish flu. Third, victims might succumb to secondary bacterial infections that can quickly overwhelm the already weakened immune system. In the case of HIV/AIDS, death is almost invariably the result of a secondary infection because the virus dismantles helper T cells, which severely reduces the victim's ability to fight off subsequent infectious attacks. These three strategies are not mutually exclusive; they can reinforce each other. For example, secondary infection can hasten the organ failure caused by the virus or can trigger its own cytokine attack.\u2026a growing number of researchers suspect that a major cause of death from severe influenza is a cytokine storm resulting from an overreaction of the immune system",

Other killer diseases, including malaria, also seem to owe their virulence to cytokine action (Clark et al, 2006). In such cases, it is too late not only for vaccination but also for antiviral drugs. \u201cOnce you develop a cytokine storm, the virus may go, but you will still get sick,\u201d said Tracey. He therefore argues for a more enlightened approach that considers not only vaccines and antivirals for standard infections, but also immunomodulatory drugs, such as corticosteroids, and new therapeutic agents against H5N1 and other viruses. In his own research, Tracey has tested antibodies against the high-mobility group box (HMGB1) protein, a cytokine involved in the repair of damaged tissue, which also has a role in cytokine storms (Wang et al, 2007). \u201cThose antibodies cure animals with established lethal infections,\u201d he said, but their successful use in humans has yet to be shown.",

If we had started to research these more carefully 10 years ago, we would have a vaccine that works against many flu viruses and also H5N1 by now,\u201d Kaufmann continued. \u201cIn principle, immunological rules tell us that we can broaden the immune response by targeting conserved regions [of an infectious agent].\u201d",

By their estimation, an ICU admission rate of 15%, and an estimated need for half of these patients to receive ventilation assistance to counteract respiratory failure, would be sufficient to cause the collapse of intensive care resources in the UK. There is also the logistical problem of vaccine production and distribution. Although the basic technology of flu vaccine production in chicken eggs has not progressed since the early 1950s, the potential for a global spread of infection has changed. The increase in international air travel now means that a pandemic could spread around the world much more quickly, thereby increasing pressure on vaccine manufacturers.
