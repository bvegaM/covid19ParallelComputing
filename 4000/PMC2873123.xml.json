Eligible hospitalized children were <5 years of age and had received an admission diagnosis of fever alone or of acute respiratory infection, which was defined as an illness presenting with fever and/or 1 or more of the following symptoms: cough, earache, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, vomiting after coughing, wheezing, and labored, rapid, or shallow breathing. Children were excluded if they had respiratory symptoms that had lasted >14 days at the time of admission, had neutropenia from chemotherapy, were hospitalized elsewhere within the preceding 4 days, or were newborns who had been hospitalized since birth. Study nurses enrolled children admitted to surveillance hospitals from Sunday through Thursday, after obtaining written informed consent. Children were eligible for enrollment if they were admitted within 48 h of an enrollment day. Nasal and throat specimens were obtained with swabs from all children on the day of enrollment (thus within 48 h of admission), combined into a single tube of viral transport medium, and promptly delivered to the research laboratories at the study sites. Demographic and clinical information was collected using a standardized questionnaire, as described elsewhere [22, 26]. We performed statistical comparisons between children infected with HMPV alone and children infected with other specific viruses alone; children with >1 virus detected in their specimens were excluded from analysis. Children were considered to be virus-negative if their specimens tested negative for HMPV, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), human rhinovirus (HRV), and human coronavirus by testing methods that are described below. Highrisk conditions were assessed, which included history of asthma, heart disease, sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, diabetes mellitus, and neuromuscular conditions such as seizures, cerebral palsy, or muscular dystrophy. History of asthma was determined by asking the parents if their child had ever received a diagnosis of asthma from any health care provider or by documentation of a previous diagnosis of asthma in the medical record [24].",

Specimens were tested for HMPV by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), as described elsewhere [1, 27]. Specimens were also tested for influenza virus, RSV, PIV, HRV, and human coronavirus by real-time RT-PCR [23\u201325, 28, 29]. Specimens that tested positive for HMPV were subjected to conventional nested RT-PCR to amplify and sequence complementary DNA of the F and G genes, as described elsewhere [1]. HMPV subgroup assignment was made on the basis of either the F or the G gene; either gene reliably identifies the viral subgroup [30]. Sequences were edited and aligned with published HMPV sequences obtained from GenBank by means of the ClustalW algorithm in MacVector software (version 10.0; Accelrys). Phylogenetic analyses were performed using Mega software (version 4) [31]. The data sets were resampled with 500 bootstraps, distances were computed using the maximum composite likelihood method, and phylogeny was inferred using the neighbor-joining method [31]. Analyses that made use of the maximum parsimony and minimum evolution methods yielded similar results (data not shown), and so only the results of the neighbor-joining analysis are shown.",

The median age of children who tested positive for HMPV alone was 6 months (range, 2\u201313 months), similar to the median age of those with RSV infection or influenza, whereas children with PIV or HRV infection were older. Sex, race, history of premature birth, and insurance status did not differ between groups. Attendance in out-of-home daycare was less common among children with HMPV infection and those with influenza, compared with those with RSV, PIV, or HRV infection. Children with HMPV infection and children with influenza had slightly higher rates of exposure to household tobacco smoke, compared with children in other groups. Proportions of general high-risk status (including asthma) were higher among children with HMPV or HRV infection, whereas proportions of underlying asthma alone were similar between children with HMPV infection, RSV infection, or no virus identified. Underlying asthma alone was more common among children with HRV infection and less common among children with influenza.",

The overall annual incidence was 1.2 HMPV-associated hospitalizations (95% CI, 0.9\u20131.6) per 1000 children <5 years of age; the age-specific incidence was highest among younger children: 4.9 (95% CI, 2.9- 7.2) for children 0\u20135 months of age, 2.9 (95% CI, 1.4\u20134.7) for children 6\u201311 months of age, 0.7 (95% CI, 0.1\u20131.4) for children 12\u201323 months of age, and 0.4 (95% CI, 0.1\u20130.7) for children 24\u201359 months of age.

Conversely, difficulty breathing and wheezing were more common among HMPV-infected children than among children with influenza or children with no virus detected. Sore throat was most common among children with HMPV or PIV infection. Thirty-eight percent of the HMPVinfected children required supplemental oxygen, and 2% were treated in the intensive care unit; these proportions were similar to those for other viruses. No child with HMPV infection in this study died, and the mean duration of hospitalization was 2 days, similar for all viruses. Thirteen children with HMPV detection had codetection of other viruses, including 6 with HRV detection, 4 with influenza virus detection, 2 with RSV detection, and 1 with PIV-3 detection. The most common discharge diagnoses among children with HMPV infection only were bronchiolitis (38%), pneumonia (24%), asthma (24%), and upper respiratory tract infection (3%). Bronchiolitis was most common among children with HMPV or RSV infection, whereas pneumonia was more common among HMPV-infected children. A discharge diagnosis of asthma was common in all groups but was less frequent among children with influenza (9%) and most frequent among HRV-infected children (46%). Other diagnoses included croup in a substantial number of children with influenza and PIV infection [25, 29] and febrile illness alone in children with no respiratory virus identified.",

The contribution of HMPV infection to pediatric hospitalization for ARI or fever was substantial, with 1.2 hospitalizations per 1000 children <5 years old per year (95% CI, 0.9\u20131.6), compared with 3.0 per 1000 (95% CI, 2.8\u20133.4) for RSV, 0.9 per 1000 (95% CI, 0.8\u20131.1) for influenza virus, and 0.5 per 1000 (95% CI, 0.4\u20130.6) for PIV-3 [23, 25, 29]. The rate of HMPV-associated hospitalization was highest among infants 0\u20135 months old, at 4.9 per 1000 (95% CI, 2.9\u20137.2), compared with 16.9 per 1000 (95% CI, 15.3\u201318.5) for RSV, 4.5 per 1000 (95% CI, 3.4\u20135.5) for influenza virus, and 1.6 per 1000 (95% CI, 1.0\u20132.2) for PIV-3 [23, 25, 29]. These data suggest that HMPV causes hospitalizations for respiratory symptoms and fever in children <5 years old at rates similar to those of influenza virus and PIV. If we extrapolate from US Census data, then our data would project \u223c27,000 HMPV-related hospitalizations of children <5 years of age annually, which underscores the impact of HMPV infection on children. HMPV is rarely detected in asymptomatic young children [2, 3, 32, 33].",

One-third of the hospitalized children with HMPV infection in our study had highrisk conditions, which suggests that these children are at higher risk for hospitalization with HMPV infection.

We did not observe an association between HMPV hospitalization and a history of asthma, in contrast to the association between asthma and HRV infection that was previously found in this cohort [24, 36]. Consistent with previous reports, HMPV infection was associated most frequently with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis [2, 5, 7, 19, 21]. The presenting symptoms of HMPV infection in this cohort generally were not distinct from those of children infected with other viruses, consistent with other reports [1, 2, 5, 7, 19, 21, 37, 38].

Overall, HMPV infection accounted for up to 15% of all hospitalizations for children <5 years old with ARI or fever with a late spring distribution and was more common than influenza or RSV infection during this time period [23, 25]. However, the lack of distinctive clinical symptoms and the overlap with other community respiratory virus infections highlights the potential utility of rapid, sensitive diagnostic tests such as RT-PCR to detect HMPV and other respiratory viruses.",

The extent of antigenic variability between HMPV subgroups is not clear in animals or in humans [30, 39\u201341], but the presence of multiple HMPV strains in a single season could affect the design of vaccines or prophylactic antibodies if antigenic variability leads to partial immune escape. We did not find that specific subgroups were associated with more severe disease (data not shown); some studies have suggested this phenomenon [42], whereas others have not [43]. Correlation between infecting subtype and disease severity has been shown for RSV infection [44, 45]. A postulated mechanism for alternating circulation of different HMPV subgroups is population immune pressure [46, 47]. Long-term, prospective, population-based surveillance is needed to establish whether different subgroups of HMPV vary in virulence and whether circulation patterns are the result of immune pressure.",

First, surveillance was performed for only 2 years at only 2 geographically distant sites (representing 2 US regions, Northeast and South). Greater regional and temporal differences in viral circulation may have been evident if the study included more years or sites, because other studies have reported substantial year-to-year variability in HMPV infection prevalence [1]. Second, institutional differences in medical practice might have contributed to variation in HMPV-related hospitalization rates, and although enrolled and nonenrolled children did not differ in demographic characteristics, unknown biases may have affected our HMPV infection burden estimates. Coinfections were present in a minority of children, but the clinical importance of these coinfections is not clear. HRV is identified frequently in asymptomatic individuals and thus is especially difficult to interpret as a codetected virus [48\u201350]. A large number of children in the study did not have a virus identified by means of the testing used; this could be attributable to false negative test results or to the presence of other pathogens for which we did not test. Nearly all of the HMPV-infected children had ARI symptoms and not fever alone, but we enrolled children with fever alone in addition to children with ARI. Thus, because the population-based incidence was calculated with all hospitalized children, including those with fever alone, we may have underestimated the true incidence of infection with HMPV (and other viruses) among children with ARI. Finally, this study only assessed hospitalized children, and the impact of HMPV infection on emergency department and outpatient visits is unknown.",
