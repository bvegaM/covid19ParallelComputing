            "text": "MIM1,2 is a comprehensive knowledgebase of human genes and genetic disorders. It consists of full-text overviews of genes and genetic phenotypes, particularly disorders, and is useful to students, researchers, and clinicians. It was initiated in the early 1960s as a trilogy of catalogs of autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked phenotypes. It has been maintained as an electronic file since 1964 and has been published in 12 print editions (fig. 1), the first in 1966, the most recent (in three volumes) in 1998. (Various editions of MIM were translated into Russian [1976], Spanish [1976], and Mandarin [1996]; see fig. 2.) In 1987, it became generally available on the Internet, under the designation \u201cOMIM,\u201d from the Welch Medical Library at Johns Hopkins University. Since December 1995, it has been distributed on the World Wide Web from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) of the National Library of Medicine. This knowledgebase is updated daily. Authoring and editing are headquartered at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.",

Also, the distinction is only relative\u2014that is, whether dominant or recessive sometimes depends on the level at which the phenotype is analyzed. For example, in several of the red-cell enzymopathies, the deficiency state is autosomal recessive but the electrophoretic variation is likely to be demonstrable in the heterozygote\u2014that is, it is dominant, or at least intermediate, in its inheritance. Furthermore, there are rather numerous examples of particular phenotypes that are inherited as dominant or recessive based on different mutations in the same gene. Table 15 on page l in the preface of MIM122 listed 11 disorders that have both dominant and recessive forms resulting from different mutations in the same gene. Some mutations that cause absent function of the protein\u2014that is, null mutations\u2014produce phenotypic effects only with homozygosity; missense mutations may cause the disorder because of a dominant negative effect when, for example, the structure of a protein that is part of a heteromeric protein complex is altered.",

As of January 29, 2007, 6,146 of the >17,300 entries in OMIM represented phenotypes (see table 1 and fig. 3); the rest related to genes. Beginning in the late 1960s, entries were created in MIM for individual genes for which no associated Mendelian phenotype was known. The method of interspecific (e.g., mouse-human) somatic cell hybridization made it possible to map genes to specific human chromosomes without the existence of a Mendelizing phenotype that could be used in family linkage studies. The difference between the genomes of the two species in the hybrid substituted for the differences between the genomes inherited from father and mother used in family linkage mapping. Thus, when the thymidine kinase gene (TK1 [MIM *188300]) was mapped to chromosome 17 by study of mouse-human hybrid cell lines,13,14 an entry was created for the gene, even though no Mendelian variation was known. Already, separate entries had been created for hemoglobin genes such as HBB, the lactate dehydrogenase genes such as LDHA (MIM +150000), and the G6PD gene (MIM +305900), among others. As mapping and cloning of genes advanced, the genes involved were given new entries in MIM, again although no Mendelian variation may have been known. Until the generic autosomal catalog was established (in 1994), autosomal \u201cgene entries\u201d were arbitrarily incorporated in the autosomal dominant catalog.",

Searchability helped to avoid duplications and inconsistencies and allowed entries to be related to each other\u2014cross-referenced\u2014more easily. Beginning in September 1987, OMIM was made generally accessible on the Internet from the Welch Medical Library of Johns Hopkins University. The informatics aspects of OMIM were transferred to the NCBI of the National Library of Medicine on December 1, 1995. Thus, in the 31 years from 1964 to 1995, MIM went from a solitary resource on magnetic tape to a cornerstone genetics resource on the World Wide Web, integrated with other primary genetic data sources.

Two hundred years ago, angina pectoris, asthma, consumption, dropsy, jaundice, stroke, and many symptom complexes were viewed and managed as though they were distinct entities with a single etiology.",

The VHL gene (MIM *608537) is mutant in von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (MIM #193300), which has renal cancer, pheochromocytoma, and cerebellar hemangioblastoma as components; it is implicated also in sporadic cases of these three neoplasms.

(Li-Fraumeni syndrome is genetically heterogeneous; in addition to the LFS1 form caused by mutations in TP53, another form, LFS2 [MIM #609265], is caused by mutations in the CHEK2 gene [MIM *604373], and a third form, LFS3 [MIM %609266], maps to a locus on 1q23.)",

In females with an X-autosome translocation, the derivative X chromosome (the derivative chromosome with the centromere of the X) is active in all cells; if the derivative X chromosome were inactive (lyonized), its autosomal component would likewise be inactive, with cell-lethal effects due to autosomal monosomy. Thus, the normal X chromosome is the inactive one, and the derivative X\u2014which may have disruption of the gene at the breakpoint\u2014is the active one. The breakpoint, therefore, marks the site of the gene responsible for the disorder in the patient.

After the initial creation of individual entries, information provided by new publications was usually added at the end of the existing record. Even when many entries in MIM reached a volume requiring reorganization into topical sections, the diachronic approach was maintained in each section; thus, the historical development of human genetics and particularly medical genetics is evident. The line-up of the 12 print editions of MIM (1966\u20131998) reflects that progress (fig. 1).

Precise diagnosis is the basis for quality care and for accurate genetics counseling and appropriate therapy. It appears that many clinicians and counselors use OMIM as a reference in patient care. Information on prognosis, potential complications, and possibilities for prenatal diagnosis and carrier detection is important to the care of patients, both by specialists in medical genetics and by other health professionals who may rarely encounter these disorders. The diagnostic usefulness of OMIM is enhanced by the Clinical Synopsis section provided with most phenotype entries. Through NCBI, OMIM is linked to other online clinical resources such as the highly useful GeneTests, a directory of >600 laboratories that perform diagnostic testing on >1,300 disorders (November 2006).
