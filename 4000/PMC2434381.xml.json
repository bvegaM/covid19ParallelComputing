Although parenteral vaccination is usually effective in eliciting a protective immune response, the response is not desired as the virus enters the body via the mucosal surfaces. This mucosa-centric nature of virus infection provides a strong rationale for development of mucosal vaccines to induce sufficient mucosal response to prevent the virus from establishing the mucosa as a site of continued replication and dissemination to other tissues.1\u20133 Furthermore, these studies suggest that a vaccine that induces local mucosal immunity, in particular the induction of local CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) may control viral replication within local tissues prior to systemic dissemination.4 These results also provide strong support for development of new generation vaccines that induce mucosal secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) against virus.5,6",

Efficient protection against mucosal infections requires the development of new vaccines that induce protective immune responses not only at systemic level, but also mucosal level in order to prevent or reduce dissemination of virus at the mucosa. This can best be achieved by mucosal vaccination, a route which offers several advantages over the traditional parenteral vaccines.16\u201318 However, as the local administration of pure antigens or subunit vaccines is usually rather inefficient, several strategies have been developed to deliver the antigen in an immunogenic and protected form at the targeted mucosa. One promising approach relies on the use of live bacterial vehicles.19\u201321",

The immunogenicity of the two recombinant strains was analysed after intragastric administration of live bacteria to mice.

The vaccine groups of 30 mice received dose of 109 cells of two recombinant strains, respectively. The groups of 30 mice immunized with equivalent dose of L. casei 393, L. casei 393 containing empty plasmid or received PBS were used as control. All the mice were immunized via oral route. The immune protocol was administered on three consecutive days at days 0, 1and 2. A booster immunization was given at days 14, 15 and 16 and a second booster was given at days 28, 29 and 30.34",

The initial infection of PPV mainly occurs at the mucosa of intestines; this is a critical step in the infection process.7 Vaccination is the main prophylatic method of preventing PPV infection. Parenteral vaccination is usually effective in eliciting systemic immune responses; however, the responses obtained can not prevent the virus from entering the body via the mucosal surfaces. Therefore, the elicitation of efficient immune response, not only at the systemic, but also at the mucosal level is highly desirable after vaccination. This goal can be only achieved when the vaccine formulation is administered by the mucosal route. As such, a great deal of research is currently focused on the development of adequate mucosal vaccines, with various vaccine delivery systems being explored for oral application. Attenuated pseudorabies virus carrying the VP2 protein of PPV was able to protect mice against viral challenge.37 Other live vectors such as vaccinia virus expressing PPV proteins stimulated protective immune responses. However, the majority of these live vectors are potentially risk prone.",

In contrast, rLc393:pPG612.1-VP2 expressing VP2 in the external milieu induced much higher antibody level of local mucosal or systemic immune response in mice than that elicited by rLc393:pPG611.1-VP2 displaying VP2 on cell surface. Statistically significant differences were observed on days 32, 46 and 58. As estimated by quantitative immunoblot analysis, this difference could be related to varying levels of VP2 production depending on the cellular location of the antigen; therefore, the strong immunogenicity most probably results from the high level of external milieu VP2 product in rLc393:pPG612.1-VP2, which could effectively reacted with intestine mucosal tissues. We hypothesize that the VP2 protein expressed by rLc393:pPG611.1-VP2 may be embedded in the cell wall and only partly accessible to cell surface, which could not fully associate with gut lymphoid tissue resulting in the lower level of immune antibodies than that induced by rLc393:pPG612.1-VP2.",

Several factors may explain these differences. Successful mucosal immunization requires the delivery of a minimal threshold load of antigen. Therefore, it is possible that the recombinant strain described by Shaw et al. produces insufficient antigen quantities at the cell surface. Alternatively, intrinsic immunostimulatory properties of L. casei ATCC 393, yet to be determined, may differ from those of L. plantarum 256, used by Shaw et al. The strain used in this study was able to adhere and colonize the intestinal tracts and tolerate bile (data not shown), which would render it more appropriate an oral vaccine carrier with the probiotic effects and the harmless nature of L. casei 393.",
