            "text": "PARPs catalyse the transfer and polymerization of ADP-ribose units from NAD+ to form a ramified polymer\u2014known as PAR\u2014which can be covalently linked mainly to glutamic residues of acceptor proteins (Fig 1). DNA-strand breakage was long considered to be the main trigger of PAR synthesis through the activation of PARP1, which led to opposite outcomes\u2014repair of the damaged site and cell survival, or cell death\u2014depending on the cellular context and on the intensity of the DNA insult. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in response to DNA damage is highly energy-consuming, as PAR size is estimated to reach up to 200 units under stress conditions. However, the size and branching of PAR synthesized under normal conditions is still unclear. The recent discovery of novel putative PARP proteins\u2014which have increased the number of PARP family members to 17 (Fig 2)\u2014has considerably extended the field of study of this protein modification, which occurs only in non-yeast eukaryotes (Am\u00e9 et al, 2004; Otto et al, 2005; Schreiber et al, 2006). It remains to be determined whether all PARP family members can effectively synthesize PAR and, if so, whether this PAR has a comparable structure to that synthesized by the founding member PARP1. In addition, some PARP family members, which lack conserved residues crucial for polymer elongation, could instead be mono(ADP-ribose) transferases. A detailed biochemical characterization of each PARP family member will allow us to answer these questions in the future. PAR can be degraded either by PARG\u2014which is encoded by a single gene but is present in different isoforms that show various subcellular localizations (for a review, see Gagne et al, 2006)\u2014or by the recently described ARH3, which shares little, if any, sequence similarity with PARG (Oka et al, 2006). However, if, how and when the last ADP-ribose moiety is removed from the target protein by a lyase activity remains an open question.",

            "text": "Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation modulates protein function by regulating either enzymatic activities or macromolecular interactions with proteins, DNA or RNA. On the other hand, PAR molecules can also regulate protein activity and function through non-covalent binding. This is illustrated by the exponentially growing list of protein\u2013protein, protein\u2013DNA and protein\u2013RNA interactions that either require or are prevented by PAR. However, the role of non-covalent PAR-binding is likely to attract protein targets to specific subcellular sites. A somewhat conserved 20 amino-acid PAR-binding motif was initially established from the analysis of several DNA-repair and checkpoint proteins (Pleschke et al, 2000). More recently, some macro domains\u2014such as those found in PARP9 or in a viral protein from the SARS coronavirus\u2014and a C2H2 zinc-finger, known as the PBZ, have also been shown to bind to PAR in vitro (Ahel et al, 2008; Egloff et al, 2006; Karras et al, 2005). In some cases, a single protein target can bind to PAR non-covalently and also be an acceptor for poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, which are processes that probably have different functional outcomes, such as recruitment to a site were PAR is produced and modification of the activity of the recruited protein, respectively. Whether the effect of PAR is due to steric hindrance or to electrostatic repulsion generated by the negatively charged ADP-ribose polymers is still an open question. Differences in the length and branching of PAR probably add another level of regulation that could allow different functional outcomes (Fahrer et al, 2007).",

            "text": "Among the alternative roles proposed for PAR is the provocative but appealing idea of it being a local supply of ATP molecules, which is important in conditions of ATP shortage. PARP1 activation in response to DNA breaks could support the ATP supply necessary for ligation, which is the final step of single-strand break repair (SSBR). Converting PAR into ATP requires pyrophosphate, the by-product of nucleotide incorporation, which occurs during DNA-repair synthesis (Petermann et al, 2003). Supporting this idea, AMPK, which is activated when the ATP concentration is limiting, phosphorylates PARP1, thereby enhancing its automodification (Walker et al, 2006).",

PAR is a crucial regulator of the DNA-damage response that involves the SSBR/BER pathway. PARP1 activation by DNA breaks leads to the relaxation of chromatin superstructure owing to poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of histones\u2014mainly H1\u2014and favours the recruitment of repair factors that have a strong affinity for PAR, such as the SSBR/BER-repair scaffold protein XRCC1 (El-Khamisy et al, 2003; Okano et al, 2003). The interaction of PAR with many other repair factors and checkpoint proteins probably also contributes to the DNA-damage response (Ahel et al, 2008; Haince et al, 2008). The prevention of PAR synthesis by PARP inhibitors, or Parp1 gene disruption in mice, leads to repair defects, cell-cycle perturbation and increased genomic instability, emphasizing the function of PARP1 as a caretaker of the genome (Masutani et al, 1999; Menissier de Murcia et al, 1997; Wang et al, 1997). The regulation of chromatin structure by PARP1 and PAR has been studied in vitro and in vivo at inducible mammalian promoters, and also in Drosophila\u2014which contains only homologues of PARP1, tankyrase 1 and PARP16\u2014at stress-activated puff loci. These studies revealed that PARP1 can regulate chromatin architecture, nucleosome removal and transcription activation in response to the appropriate stimulus (Kraus, 2008; Krishnakumar et al, 2008; Petesch & Lis, 2008; Tulin & Spradling, 2003).",

This discovery led to a model in which PAR is a crucial regulator of cell fate in response to DNA damage, allowing a rapid cellular evaluation of the extent of damage, and controlling the decision between life and death. According to this model, PARP1 activation by tolerable amounts of DNA breaks favours DNA repair and cell survival, whereas PARP1 deficiency or inhibition affects DNA-break repair, delays cell-cycle progression and triggers apoptotic cell death\u2014making PARP inhibitors promising therapeutic molecules to potentiate the action of genotoxic antitumoral drugs (Curtin, 2005). The overactivation of PARP1 upon severe DNA injury was shown to trigger cell death by a caspase-independent but AIF-dependent mechanism (Yu et al, 2006). In addition, PAR was shown to be required for the sequential activation of calpain and proapoptotic factor BAX, which leads to AIF translocation from the mitochondria to the nucleus, where it induces large-scale DNA fragmentation and subsequent PARP1 overactivation, leading to energy depletion and cell death (Moubarak et al, 2007; Yu et al, 2006). PARP1\u2212/\u2212 mice and mice treated with PARP inhibitors show protection from tissue injury and organ failure in various oxidative stress-related disease models\u2014such as acute and chronic inflammatory diseases or ischaemia\u2014and neurodegenerative disorders (Jagtap & Szabo, 2005).",

Animal models that are genetically deficient in PARP family members have allowed the discovery of new and diverse physiological roles of PARPs and PAR, for example, in fat metabolism, spermatogenesis and T-cell development (PARP2\u2212/\u2212; Yelamos et al, 2008) or in PDGF signalling (TiPARP\u2212/\u2212; Schmahl et al, 2007). Double-knockout mice have also underscored the possible partial redundancy between some PARP family members, such as PARP1 and PARP2, or tankyrase 1 and tankyrase 2 (Chiang et al, 2008; Menissier de Murcia et al, 2003). Interestingly, PARP1\u2212/\u2212 mice have mainly revealed phenotypes in physiopathological situations, such as sensitivity towards genotoxic agents, and protection from inflammatory and neurological disorders, as mentioned above. The role of PARPs/PAR in carcinogenesis is less clear. PARP9/BAL1\u2014which is overexpressed in some high-risk B lymphomas and able to promote cell migration\u2014is suspected to participate in tumour progression (Juszczynski et al, 2006), whereas vPARP\u2212/\u2212 mice show increased sensitivity to carcinogen-induced colon tumours (Raval-Fernandes et al, 2005). The role of PARP1 in carcinogenesis is also still ambiguous; the susceptibility of PARP1\u2212/\u2212 mice to chemically induced and spontaneous tumour development seems to depend not only on the carcinogen and the target organ, but also on which one of the three existing PARP1\u2212/\u2212 mice models is used (Martin-Oliva et al, 2006; Miwa & Masutani, 2007; Tong et al, 2007). Hypoxia\u2014a phenomenon associated with tumour growth\u2014was shown to be counteracted by PARP inhibitors or by genetic ablation of PARP1 (Martin-Oliva et al, 2006). However, inhibition of PARP activity has promising outcomes in cancer treatment, as PARP inhibitors\u2014which are non-specific to PARP1 and can inhibit other PARP family members\u2014can potentiate the effect of chemotherapeutic drugs and radiotherapy, and have been shown to selectively kill tumour cells with deficiencies in BRCA1, BRCA2 and other factors involved in double-stranded DNA-break repair through homologous recombination (Turner et al, 2008). Some of these inhibitors have already entered clinical trials for cancer treatment (Curtin, 2005).",

PARP13/ZAP is a suppressor of retrovirus infection that induces viral RNA degradation (Kerns et al, 2008) and BAL1/PARP9\u2014which acts in the interferon-\u03b3 signalling pathway (Juszczynski et al, 2006)\u2014is also likely to influence host\u2013virus interactions. It will be useful to evaluate whether these PARP family members could constitute potential new therapeutic targets in viral infections.",

In Drosophila, core histones have been shown to regulate Parp1 activation differentially, with H2A and the amino-terminal tail of histone H4 having an inhibitory and stimulatory effect, respectively (Pinnola et al, 2007). Another possible PARP1 regulator that should be considered is the nuclear NAD+biosynthetic enzyme NMNAT1, which, in addition to providing PARP1 with its substrate NAD+, is able to associate with automodified PARP1. This physical interaction is sufficient to stimulate PARP1 activity in vitro, independently of NMNAT1 enzymatic activity (Berger et al, 2007).",

PARP1 activity can also be controlled by its mislocalization, as is the case during HIV-1 infection, when VPR sequesters PARP1 in the cytoplasm. This strategy allows the virus to alter the PARP1 functions that could interfere with viral pathogenesis, such as NF-\u03baB coactivation (Muthumani et al, 2006). Finally, little is known about the regulation of the other PARP family members and of the highly active PAR-degrading enzyme PARG, which also need to be tightly controlled and are therefore probably subject to stringent regulation.",

This fact is emphasized by the frequent difficulty to reconcile data obtained either in vitro or from cellular models with the apparent lack of a corresponding phenotype in genetically altered mouse models. It is interesting to note that one of the first roles of PARP1 and PAR to be discovered\u2014the regulation of chromatin structure\u2014was neglected when the appearance of mice and cellular models opened the way to physiological and pathophysiological studies. However, this function has once again come to the forefront and has been re-examined as a possible way in which to reconcile the pleiotropic functions described for PARP1 so far. In addition, the complex structural nature of the PAR produced is not yet fully understood. We still do not know if and how polymer length and ramification are regulated in vivo, and for what purpose. Many other obvious questions are still waiting for answers (Sidebar A). Why is it worthwhile for a cell to synthesize this highly energy-consuming molecule? Why does evolution keep selecting this post-translational protein modification, and driving the appearance of additional PARP family members in higher eukaryotes and of functional splicing variants for many PARPs (Otto et al, 2005; Schreiber et al, 2006)? The members of the PARP family studied so far have already emphasize the wide diversity of cellular processes in which this post-translational protein modification seems to have a crucial role. Although we have come a long way since the times when poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation was regarded as a mere curiosity, a considerable amount of time and effort will probably be required to answer all of the remaining questions regarding PAR functions and regulation (Sidebar A).",
