The I/V plots corresponding to these experiments, which were used to estimate the conductance, are shown in \u25b6. The wild-type (WT in \u25b6) conductance (\u223c45 pS) is consistent with that observed in previous reports for the full-length and N-terminal fragment (Wilson et al. 2004). This demonstrates that the stretch of amino acids used here is responsible for channel activity. Also, we point out that this conductance is observed in the presence of the two lysine residues at N and C termini, which were introduced to increase solubility and facilitate purification of the synthetic peptide.",

However, conductance in the double mutants (N15A\u2013V25F and V25A\u2013A32F) was not affected by the addition of amantadine, which may reflect a significant structural change. Two situations are possible: (1) Amantadine still binds but is not effective in inhibiting ion flow, or (2) amantadine does not bind at all. The latter, as stated above, would explain the high conductance of the double mutants relative to the single mutants by a destabilization of the membrane.",

As predicted from the model in \u25b6, significant binding was only observed for F23A (k\nD \u223c14 mM), whereas only what appeared to be nonspecific aggregation was observed for N15A, V25F, and A32F, suggesting an alteration of the native oligomeric structure in these samples. This is also consistent with our observation that conductance cannot be inhibited by amantadine in V25F\u2013A23F or N15AV25F (\u25b6), despite the fact that these samples show high conductance. Therefore, we conclude that the latter is due to membrane permeabilization in this case.",

However, the results obtained with the other mutations could not have been anticipated in the absence of our model. In summary, our results not only confirm that the ion conductance properties of SARS-CoV E reside in the transmembrane domain, we also show that a peptide flanked by two lysine residues (K2-ETM-K2) (Torres et al. 2006) for which a homopentameric \u03b1-helical bundle model was proposed, is a good model to study its channel properties. Further, we report that this peptide incorporated in lipid bilayers binds amantadine with relatively high affinity, at least comparable to influenza A M2.

Decane (\u226599%) and (N-[2-hydroxyethyl]piperazine-N\u2032-[2-ethanesulfonicacid]) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, chloroform from Sigma-Aldrich, and ethanol (\u226599%) and sodium chloride (NaCl) were obtained from Fluka. Ion channel formation of ETM was measured by (Wilson et al. 2004) forming planar lipid bilayers across a 250-\u03bcm aperture in the wall of a Delrin cup separating the aqueous solutions in the cis and trans chambers. The working volume was of 1 mL in each chamber. A lipid mixture of 5:3:2, POPE:POPS:POPC (50 mg/mL) was dissolved in chloroform and dried under N2 gas. The lipid cake was then resuspended in decane. A small amount of lipid mixture was painted across the aperture of the Delrin cup. About 14\u201320 \u03bcg of SARS-CoV ETM protein was added to the cis chamber under continuous stirring, until ion channel activity was detected, typically after 15\u201330 min. The chambers contained 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.2 (cis), and 5 mM NaCl and 5 mM of HEPES, pH 7.2 (trans). Recordings were performed in asymmetric ionic conditions using a different buffer. The cis and trans solutions were connected via an Ag/AgCl electrode and 1 M NaCl, 2% agar bridge. Currents were amplified using a Warner Instrument amplifier and digitized at 5 kHz and filtered at 10 kHz using pCLAMP 9.2 software (Axon Instruments, Inc.). The trans chamber was set as reference and the cis chamber was held at different potentials ranging from 0 to 80 mV, in 20 mV increments. Stirring was stopped after detection of channel activity. The ion selectivity experiment was performed with 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.2) in the cis chamber, and 500 mM CaCl2, 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.2) in the trans chamber.",
