Indeed, these techniques offer the potential for multiplex testing platforms (Lee et al, 2007; Mahony et al, 2007; Nolte et al, 2007). This is important because of the non\u2010specific clinical presentation of these infections. This \u201csyndromic\u201d nature of respiratory viral infections will ultimately require a multiplex testing platform for comprehensive detection of these pathogens. Several assays have been described in the literature. The Hexaplex\u2122 assay detects seven respiratory viruses and has shown excellent performance characteristics in various clinical settings (Hindiyeh et al, 2001; Kehl et al, 2001). Another multiplex platform (MultiCode\u2010PLx system, EraGen Biosciences, Inc., Madison, WI) detected 17 respiratory viruses simultaneously and showed significantly increased diagnostic yield compared to DFA or culture methods. This was mainly caused by improved detection of influenza A virus and viruses not readily detected by standard virological methods, including HMPV, HcoV, and HRhV (Nolte et al, 2007). A 20\u2010respiratory virus microbead\u2010based assay also showed excellent sensitivity and specificity, as well as an increased yield for detection of viruses that are difficult to detect by culture or DFA (Mahony et al, 2007). Microarray and nanotechnologies are also being explored in order to develop large\u2010scale and efficient viral detection platforms (Liu et al, 2006; Chiu et al, 2007; Fournier\u2010Wirth & Coste, 2007).",

URI precedes pneumonia in 80\u201390% of patients, and approximately 30\u201340% of patients with RSV URI progress to pneumonia after a median of 7 d. However, in some patients with RSV pneumonia, URI is not present, is very mild, or occurs only concurrently with the onset of pneumonia (Nichols et al, 2001a). Strongest risk factors for progression to pneumonia are older age and lymphopenia (Nichols et al, 2001a). During the first 3 months after HCT, patients receiving non\u2010myeloablative conditioning regimens seem to be protected from progression to lower respiratory tract disease (Schiffer et al, 2006). Following reduced intensity conditioning, regimens may also have a somewhat lower risk of progression and fatal disease (Chakrabarti et al, 2002), however, larger studies are needed to better define the risk of progression. Most studies indicate that asymptomatic shedding of RSV is not a common phenomenon (Ljungman et al, 1989; Adams et al, 1999; Peck et al, 2007).",

            "text": "Without treatment, RSV pneumonia is almost uniformly fatal in highly immunosuppressed HCT recipients (Harrington et al, 1992). However, recovery from RSV lower respiratory tract disease without specific treatment has been reported (Abdallah et al, 2003). These differences are probably due to less intense immunosuppressive regimens and whether lymphopenia is present at the time of diagnosis (Chemaly et al, 2006). Pulmonary copathogens are detected in up to one third of the patients with RSV pneumonia and require aggressive treatment. No adequately powered controlled trials exist for the treatment of RSV infection and pneumonia in the HCT setting. Available evidence comes from small uncontrolled cohort studies and one small randomized trial (Boeckh et al, 2007). The data suggest that treatment of early pneumonia (i.e. prior to mechanical ventilation) is associated with improved outcome. Intermittent short duration (2 g, over 2 h, three times per day) or continuous aerosolized ribavirin is considered the treatment of choice for RSV pneumonia. With this regimen, the 30\u2010d all\u2010cause mortality is approximately 40% (Table I). In a large multivariate analysis, RSV pneumonia (but not URI) was independently associated with mortality (Nichols et al, 2001a). Systemic ribavirin alone does not seem to be effective for the treatment of pneumonia (Lewinsohn et al, 1996; Sparrelid et al, 1997); better response rates were reported for treatment of RSV URI, however, the small sample size limits the strength of the data (Schleuning et al, 2004). There are no data on combined oral and aerosolized ribavirin.",

Uncontrolled data suggest that high\u2010titer antibody preparations or palivizumab may be required if such adjunctive therapy is given (DeVincenzo et al, 2000; Boeckh et al, 2001; Small et al, 2002). There are several factors that may account for differences in outcome in the available cohort studies. One important factor appears to be the timing of initiation of therapy. Several studies suggest that, when treatment is started after respiratory failure has occurred, it is almost uniformly unsuccessful (Whimbey et al, 1995). Other factors that may explain the differences in outcome between studies include: the presence of lymphopenia at the time of diagnosis, the presence of co\u2010pathogens (e.g. invasive moulds), and the use of immunosuppressive agents (Ljungman, 2001; Boeckh et al, 2004; Chemaly et al, 2006). Available studies are too small to control for these parameter, making the interpretation of results of pharmacological interventions difficult. Most centers now agree that aerosolized ribavirin should be given to HCT patients with RSV lower respiratory tract disease. There is no consensus on the role of antibody preparations, however, the author uses palivizumab for radiographically and virologically proven RSV pneumonia.",

            "text": "Due to the high mortality of RSV pneumonia, much interest has focused on prevention. A recent small controlled study of preemptive, antiviral therapy of aerosolized ribavirin, given at the time of RSV URI, showed a decline in viral load, but no significant difference in RSV pneumonia; the study was prematurely stopped due to slow accrual(Boeckh et al, 2007). A larger retrospective study suggests that this strategy may be effective (Chemaly et al, 2006). Whether ribavirin is indicated for RSV URI remains controversial; some centers (including the author\u2019s) administer it in the presence of lymphopenia (lymphocyte count <0\u00b73 \u00d7 109/l) when the risk of progression is particularly high (Boeckh et al, 2004; Chemaly et al, 2006). Lymphopenia is a highly significant risk factor for progression to lower tract disease during the first 3 months after HCT (Ljungman et al, 2001; Chemaly et al, 2006). There is no data on the risk of progression later after HCT; anecdotal experience suggests that other factors, such as poor lung function, may be more important in patients with prolonged immunosuppression; further studies are needed to define the risk factors in this setting. Whether palivizumab given preemptively to patients with RSV URI to prevent progression to lower respiratory tract disease is effective has not been definitively determined (Chavez\u2010Bueno et al, 2007; Khanna et al, 2008).",

This approach was supported by a recent study of pretransplant RSV infection, which showed rapid progression to RSV pneumonia in patients in whom the transplant procedure was not postponed (Peck et al, 2004). However, there is evidence that low\u2010risk autologous transplant patients may be transplanted without adverse outcome (Aslan et al, 1999).

Structurally, the virus is closely related to RSV. By the age of 5 years, virtually all children are seropositive. The virus can cause upper and lower tract infection during the winter season (Boivin et al, 2002). Serious lower respiratory tract disease associated with HMPV has been reported in immunocompromised patients, but no risk factors for acquisition have been described (Table II). HMPV infection occurs in up to 5% of HCT recipients (Fig 2) (Peck et al, 2007). Whether asymptomatic shedding occurs is controversial (Debiaggi et al, 2007; Peck et al, 2007). The progression rate to lower respiratory tract disease has not been determined. Among HCT recipients undergoing bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for clinical and radiographic pneumonia, 3\u20134% had HMPV detected (Englund et al, 2006). Most of these patients were previously classified as having idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (Englund et al, 2006). HMPV disease in HCT recipients immediately post\u2010transplant presented with upper respiratory symptoms, including: fever, nasal congestion, and cough. Once pneumonia developed, rapidly progressive pulmonary infiltrates, frequently accompanied by hypotension, septic shock, or both, were observed (Englund et al, 2006). Radiographic findings ranged from diffuse bilateral alveolar and interstitial infiltrates to emphysema without infiltrate. A high viral load was observed in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Histological assessment showed that diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation, foci of bronchiolitis obliterans and organizing pneumonia, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage are common (Englund et al, 2006).",

Late airflow obstruction has been linked, not only to parainfluenzavirus pneumonia, but also to URI (Erard et al, 2006). The most important risk factors for the progression from URI to pneumonia is use of systemic corticosteroids and lymphopenia.( Nichols et al, 2001b; Chakrabarti et al, 2002). During the first 3 months after HCT, recipients of non\u2010myeloablative conditioning regimens appear to have a small risk of progression to lower respiratory tract disease (Schiffer et al, 2006). Reduced intensity conditioning regimens may also have a somewhat lower risk of progression and fatal disease (Chakrabarti et al, 2002), however, larger studies are needed to better define the risk of progression. Although the overall progression rate to pneumonia is only 18%, in allograft recipients the risk is 40% if 1 mg/kg of prednisone is given (for treatment of graft\u2010versus\u2010host disease, GvHD), and 65% with 2 mg/kg (Nichols et al, 2001b). Parainfluenzavirus 3 pneumonia may also occur after autologous transplantation, however, mainly in the setting of CD34 selection or use of high\u2010dose steroids (Nichols et al, 2001b). Parainfluenzavirus 3 pneumonia is associated with serious pulmonary co\u2010pathogens, such as Aspergillus fumigatus, in approximately half of the cases. Factors associated with poor outcome after pneumonia include presence of co\u2010pathogens and mechanical ventilation (Nichols et al, 2001b). Thus, aggressive diagnostic intervention (i.e. BAL) and therapy are indicated in patients with suspected parainfluenzavirus pneumonia. In a large retrospective analysis both URI and pneumonia, due to parainfluenzavirus 3, were associated with overall mortality in multivariable models (Nichols et al, 2001b).",

In a retrospective analysis, neither aerosolized ribavirin nor intravenous immunoglobulin led to improved outcome of pneumonia or a reduction in viral shedding following pneumonia (Nichols et al, 2001b). Systemic ribavirin has only been reported in case reports (Chakrabarti et al, 2000a). Randomized treatment studies have not been performed. No definitive assessment can be made as to whether earlier antiviral treatment (i.e. preemptive treatment for URI) is effective in the prevention of pneumonia or late airflow obstruction (Chakrabarti et al, 2000a). The association of high\u2010dose steroid treatment with progression to disease might suggest that reduction on immunosuppression may be useful (Nichols et al, 2001b), however, such an approach has not been tested. The role of immunoglobulin in the treatment of parainfluenzavirus infections is also poorly defined. One retrospective analysis did not find a benefit of pooled immunoglobulin given for parainfluenzavirus pneumonia (Nichols et al, 2001b). However, antibody content in pooled preparations is highly variable.

Not all transplant centers have a universal mask policy. Recent CDC guidelines recommend using masks during patient transport [CDC/IDSA/ASBMT (2000)]. Another approach that is likely to reduce transmission is to restrict health care workers and family members from patient contact if they have URI and systemic symptoms, such as rhinorhea, watery eyes, sneezing, fever, and myalgia (Boeckh et al, 2004). Such a strategy will only be effective for infections that present with significant drainage and symptoms, such as RSV, rhinovirus, HMPV, and influenza infections. Parainfluenzavirus infections, which may present with only mild symptoms, may be missed by this approach (Nichols et al, 2004a; Peck et al, 2007).
