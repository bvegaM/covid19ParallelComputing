By 4 days after infection, interstitial disease was predominantly mononuclear and was accompanied variably by increased numbers of alveolar macrophages and exudates (Figure 1, A and B). Hyaline membranes were rarely observed, however, multinucleated syncytia were first apparent at this time (Figure 1A). By day 7 after infection, pneumonitis appeared to be resolving in some animals, but edema was observed in a patchy distribution. In others, pulmonary inflammation persisted and was accompanied by consolidation of alveolar spaces and proliferation of type II pneumocytes (Figure 1B). Microscopically, tracheobronchial lymph node enlargement was associated with parafollicular lymphocytic hyperplasia and histiocytosis within the subcapsular sinuses. Given the small numbers of animals at each time point, it was not possible to reach a conclusion about the peak in pathology. In some animals, it appeared that pneumonitis was resolving by day 7, but the two animals with the greatest amount of disease were euthanized on day 7 (Table 2). As a control to rule out nonspecific reactivity to components of culture medium, two animals were mock infected with Vero E6 culture supernatant and euthanized at 4 days after infection. Both remained healthy and neither developed pneumonitis.",

By 7 days after infection, all animals had evidence of multifocal hepatitis. Superimposed on this pattern in 4 of 11 animals with hepatic lesions was a multifocal inflammatory process centered on hepatic veins (Figure 3D). This pattern was characterized by a mononuclear cell cuff of variable thickness that extended into adjacent hepatic parenchyma and was associated with death of individual hepatocytes. Occasionally this process was associated with fewer than expected endothelial cells and fibrin deposition at the vessel surface. Both animals with pulmonary perivasculitis also had this hepatic lesion.

It should be noted that the pilot experiments undoubtedly underestimated the concentrations of SARS-CoV in tissues and biological specimens. Our efforts to minimize potential for aerosol formation likely limited the yield of virus from tissues.

We were unable to demonstrate viral antigen or viral RNA in hepatic tissues using the reagents and techniques available at the time. There is direct evidence that sample inhibition limited our ability to amplify gene products in hepatic tissue RNA extracts. The direct infection of hepatocytes, as yet unproven, remains our leading hypothesis for the hepatitis observed in the SARS-CoV-infected marmosets. This hypothesis will be tested in future studies using different techniques for RNA extraction and gene amplification, and different antibodies for immunohistochemistry in an effort to enhance sensitivity. An alternate hypothesis would be a triggering of a cross-reactive autoimmune response. This is considered less likely given the presence of lesions in 11 of 12 animals and the relative lack of similar inflammatory cell infiltrates in other organs (eg, kidneys).",

Such a pattern is observed in mice infected with MCMV with a peak level observed on the second day after infection.39 However, the expanding pattern of the hepatic lesions through day 7 (the latest time point of these pilot studies) and the presence of cytolytic lymphocytes in aggregates of activated cells expressing HLA-DR would also be consistent with virus-specific recognition by T lymphocytes of infected cells that are scattered in the hepatic parenchyma and lining hepatic veins. The enhancement of SARS-CoV-induced hepatitis in vaccinated ferrets would also be consistent with an earlier and more pronounced accumulation of virus-specific T lymphocytes at sites of virus replication.
