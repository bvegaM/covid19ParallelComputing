This was a prospective, longitudinal cohort study designed to capture all symptomatic episodes of URI that occurred in children during a 1-year period, to study the incidence and characteristics of URI that is complicated by OM. The study was performed at the University of Texas Medical Branch (Galveston, TX) and was approved by the Institutional Review Board; written informed consent was obtained for all subjects. Healthy children living in Galveston who had received medical care at the University of Texas Medical Branch were recruited from the primary care clinic and via advertisements in the local newspaper and at local day care centers. Children were enrolled at the ages of 6 months to 3 years. They could be asymptomatic or have had URI or AOM at the time of enrollment. Children with chronic medical problems or an anatomical or physiological defect of the ear or nasopharynx were excluded from the study. During the year, parents were asked to notify the study office as soon as the child began to have symptoms of a cold or URI (e.g., nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, cough, sore throat, or fever). Children were seen by a study physician as soon as possible after the onset and were observed a few days later to assess whether there were complications of OM; parents were compensated for time and travel. Study personnel also provided 2 home visits during weeks 2 and 3 of the URI to perform tympanometry. If the tympanogram findings remained abnormal after 3 weeks, testing was repeated every 2 weeks until the findings were normal or the next URI episode occurred. Parents were advised to bring the child for examination whenever they suspected the child to have any AOM symptom.",

OM was considered to have complicated URI if it occurred within 28 days after the onset of URI, unless new-onset URI occurred during this period; in that case, OM was considered to have complicated the most recent URI. AOM was defined as the acute onset of symptoms (fever, irritability, or earache), signs of tympanic membrane inflammation, and presence of fluid, as documented by pneumatic otoscopy and/or tympanometry. Children who received a diagnosis of AOM were treated on the basis of the standard of care [19]. OME was considered to have complicated URI if new fluid and/or an air-fluid bubble was visualized or if a new type B tympanogram result was obtained without signs of tympanic membrane inflammation. New middle ear effusion was defined as the presence of middle ear effusion without a type B tympanogram finding having been documented in the previous 30 days. Children with AOM and OME in each ear were counted as having AOM. The day of onset of OM during the course of URI was determined from day 1 (the first day of symptoms) to the first day of diagnosis.",

For each virus (except herpes simplex virus), the median age at onset of AOM was lower than that at onset of URI, suggesting that children who developed AOM were younger children. Coronavirus, RSV, and adenovirus were among the viruses associated with a higher rate of AOM. The episode data shown in table 4 were analyzed using the general estimating equations approach, which treated the child as the unit of analysis, thus accounting for the multiple correlated episodes in each child. The overall model indicated that age (P<.001) was the strongest predictor of AOM development after URI, followed by virus type (P=.05), controlling for sex (P=.19), race (P=.92), and ethnicity (P=.75). For age, the OR was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.94\u20130.98), meaning that, for each additional month of age in the URI episode, the chances of developing AOM decreased by 4%. Table 5 compares the differences among the rates of AOM associated with specific viruses. For OME outcome, general estimating equations data revealed statistical significance only for age (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96\u20130.99; P=.03).",

[25] used conventional viral assays and reported similar results. Vesa et al. [26] found that URI associated with RSV and rhinovirus had a higher rate of AOM than did URI associated with adenovirus, but these authors used PCR alone for detection of rhinovirus and antigen detection for detection of other viruses. Pitkaranta et al. [27] used RT-PCR and reported that rhinovirus (35%) was the most common virus found in cases of nasopharyngeal secretions and/or middle ear effusion in children with AOM (the rates for RSV and coronavirus were 28% and 17%, respectively), although the children in that study were relatively old (median age, 30 months). We used more-comprehensive diagnostic methods than other researchers and more often detected adenovirus during URI; the virus was also associated with the highest rate of AOM-complicated URI. We were surprised that RSV-associated URI was not diagnosed more frequently; this could be because there was an unusually low prevalence of RSV in our community during the study period or because young children with RSV infection tended to have lower respiratory tract disease rather than URI. Nevertheless, the rate of RSV-associated URI complicated by AOM was among one of the highest; this is consistent with findings from previous reports [24, 28, 29]. Our data together suggest that prevention of adenovirus- and RSV-associated URI\u2014if and when possible\u2014has the potential to make a significant impact on the incidence of AOM.",

The findings of high rates of AOM associated with isolation of adenovirus and RSV help confirm the significance of these viruses in AOM-complicated URI. We have also found that, for every virus that both culture and molecular assays detected, the rate of AOM was higher for cases detected by culture. Tissue culture is less sensitive than molecular assays and probably detects virus only in larger quantities (i.e., a high viral load). Therefore, our finding also suggests the role of high viral load in increasing URI severity. Correlations between virus concentrations and elevated levels of cytokines/inflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1, IL-8, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b1), and disease severity have been shown previously in respiratory virus infections [38\u201344].
