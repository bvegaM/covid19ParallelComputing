This process can be induced by proinflammatory cytokines, microbial products, or cross-linking of CD40 molecules.1\u20133 Mature DCs are most efficient at expressing peptide\u2013major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) on their surfaces to activate T cells, for which the high expression levels of MHC and costimulatory molecules \u2013 such as CD80, CD86 and CD40 \u2013 on the DC is essential. During this process, the DCs also acquire the ability to migrate into the inductive sites of the immune system, such as the lymph nodes, to initiate specific immune responses.",

For example, the stimulation of DC by bacterial or fungal PAMPs can result in autoimmune processes or immune responses against relatively harmless gut flora and food antigen. It can therefore be of benefit to the immune system that DCs involved in antigen presentation do not express all Toll-like receptors (TLR)s to recognize all PAMPS. With human immune defences, mainly the natural interferon producing cells (NIPC, or plasmacytoid DC) express TLR7 and TLR9, important receptors for microbial nucleic acid.4 Of course, a result of this differential TLR expression may be that myeloid DC might not be fully equipped to recognize certain viruses.",

Reactivity was detected by using phycoerythrin-conjugated goat F(ab\u2032)2 anti-mouse isotype-specific immunoglobulins (Southern Technology, Birmingham, UK). Cells only stained with the conjugate were used as negative controls. Endocytic activity of MoDCs was evaluated by incubation of the cells with ovalbumin (OVA)-dQ (10 \u00b5g/ml; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 hr at 37\u00b0.10 OVA-dQ acquires fluorescence after dequenching through proteolytic enzyme cleavage, permitting the analyses of both antigen uptake and processing. The geometric mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was quantified by flow cytometry with 25 000 events acquired, and calculated using the Flowjo program. This program was also used to determine the probability whether a test population is different from a control population. To this end, the probability binning (PB) algorithm was employed.17 This algorithm calculates the T(\u03a7) value. T(\u03a7) = 0 means that the two datasets are indistinguishable (P = 0\u00b75) and T(\u03a7) > 4 implying that the two distributions are different (P < 0\u00b701). An empirical determination for the T(\u03a7) cutoff value suitable for the present labellings was determined by measuring the variability within 10 replicates of unstimulated cultures labelled for CD80/86, MHC II and OVA-dQ. Within these labellings the T(X) values varied between 0\u00b71 and 15. Based on this, a T(X) cutoff value 20 was selected for our data in order to have a stringent cutoff.",

Although pIC and TNF-\u03b1 alone had no statistically significant effect, TNF-\u03b1 applied together with pIC was effective for induction of CD80/86 up-regulation (Fig. 1a). This was also seen with all combinations which included IFN-\u03b1. For MHC II, IFN-\u03b1 was the only stimulus able to promote the expression of MHC II when applied alone (Fig. 1b). Combinations of IFN-\u03b1 with any other stimuli, synergistically up-regulated expression of MHC II (Fig. 1b). The maturation-related phenotypic modulation was reflected in a modulated endocytic activity. Only the IFN-\u03b1 alone or cocktails containing IFN-\u03b1 together with TNF-\u03b1 or pIC, decreased the uptake of OVA-dQ, again relating to DC maturation.

As a control, TGEV was shown not to influence directly MHC II or CD80/86 expression on MoDCs (Fig. 5a, b). This was found with both the UV-inactivated and live virus (data not shown). MoDC responsiveness was controlled through the use of the IFN-\u03b1/TNF-\u03b1 cocktail to induce high expression of MHC II and CD80/86. The role of the NIPC cytokines in the indirect maturation of MoDCs was then tested. Enriched NIPC (from CD172a+ sorted cells) were stimulated overnight with TGEV, supernatants were then harvested and added to MoDC at 10% v/v. Following a further 24 hr incubation, analyses of the maturation status of the MoDCs, demonstrated that similar to the IFN-\u03b1/TNF-\u03b1 cocktail, supernatants from TGEV- or CpG-stimulated NIPC down-regulated OVA-dQ uptake and enhanced MHC II as well as CD80/86 expression (Fig. 5c). MoDC in an advanced maturation stage were identified as cells with high levels of MHC II or CD80/86 and reduced endocytic activity for the OVA (Fig. 5d, upper left quadrants of all plots). The percentage of this population was promoted by the supernatant of TGEV- or CpG-stimulated NIPC, comparable to the effects of the IFN-\u03b1/TNF-\u03b1 cocktail.",

MoDCs stimulated only with supernatants obtained from NIPC cultures without addition of the TGEV mAb, displayed phenotypic maturation measured in terms of increase of CD80/86 and MHC II (Fig. 6a, b). This related to the concentration of cytokines in the NIPC supernatants: without mAb 25-22 blocking 4451 U/ml IFN-\u03b1 and 2006 U/ml of TNF-\u03b1 were quantified whereas the anti-TGEV mAb completely abrogated these responses.

This coculture was in the presence or absence of antigen (DT control antigen or TT antigen, for which the T cells were specific) for 3 days. The IFN-\u03b1/TNF-\u03b1 treatment of DCs was more efficient than TNF-\u03b1 alone at up-regulating MHC II expression in the absence of T cells or with T cells in the absence of TT antigen (Fig. 8a, no antigen, TT antigen, T cells, DT antigen + T cells). When the TT antigen was applied, there was a clear increase in the cytokine-induced MHC II up-regulation (Fig. 8a, TT antigen + T cells). Interestingly, the enhanced up-regulation was noted when either TNF-\u03b1 alone or the IFN-\u03b1/TNF-\u03b1 cocktail was applied. This would relate to the reported \u2018terminal\u2019 maturation effect of T lymphocytes.23 Clearly, it was dependent on the presence of antigen for which the T cells were specific. Yet, in contrast to the observation shown in Fig. 8(a) for MHC II expression, no additional influence of the T lymphocytes was noted with CD80/86 expression (data not shown), implying that the IFN-\u03b1/TNF-\u03b1 cocktail had already induced their maximal expression.",

            "text": "In accordance with the concept proposed by Kitajima et al.23 T lymphocytes were also shown to play an important role in the terminal maturation of MoDC. This would support a two-step process of DC maturation. First, pro-inflammatory cytokines would prime the DCs, inducing the initial increase in the expression of costimulatory molecules such as CD80 and CD86, increased expression of MHC II may also be observed. The second signal would be delivered during the interaction of the DC with the T lymphocytes, resulting particularly in further up-regulation of the MHC II molecules on the DC. Such a mechanism has been demonstrated in vivo during response against bacterial superantigens27 as well as in severe combined immunodeficient and RAG2\u2013/\u2013 mice.28 In the present work, it was interesting to note that not only the IFN-\u03b1/TNF-\u03b1 cocktail, but also TNF-\u03b1 alone possessed the capacity to prime the DCs for \u2018terminal\u2019 maturation by T lymphocytes. In fact, the TNF-\u03b1 alone was superior in this context. It should be stressed that the model used a secondary immune response, and it can be expected that the process of \u2018terminal\u2019 maturation would be dependent on the level of T-cell activation. Clearly, the process would employ a number of molecules \u2013 cytokines and cell surface molecules, especially those involved in the formation of the immunological synapse.",

            "text": "The main aim of the present work was to identify the mechanisms behind the priming of DCs for maturation and efficient interaction with the T lymphocytes against viral pathogens for which the cells are not equipped. This can be the case for single stranded RNA viruses, which do not replicate in DC, and thus cannot trigger receptors for double stranded RNA. In this situation their maturation can only occur indirectly through cytokines produced by other cell types, in particular NIPC. When exposed to viruses such as TGEV, as well as to CpG-ODN type A, these cells are particularly potent producers of IFN-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1,11 representing the cytokine cocktail effective at inducing the first stage of DC maturation. Furthermore, porcine and human myeloid DCs do not produce IFN-\u03b1 in response to CpG type A motifs. Nevertheless, it has been recently described that porcine MoDC express some levels of TLR9 enabling them to respond to a CpG in terms of an up-regulation of MHC II and CD80/86 as well as mRNA of certain TLRs, IL-12 p35 and IFN-\u03b3.8 However, in our hands, no response of MoDC in terms of the induction of maturation and the induction of TNF-\u03b1/IFN-\u03b1 protein was detected.11 Again, this discrepancy might have been caused by different experimental procedures, readouts, source of cells or CpG sequence used.",

The importance of this functional link between the NIPC and myeloid DC has recently been reported by Fonteneau et al.29 demonstrating that human immunodeficiency virus-activated plasmacytoid DCs (NIPC) mediate an indirect maturation of CD11c+ DCs (myeloid DCs). Together, these two sets of observations confirm the concept that NIPC represent a crucial cell type in the immune system recognizing certain viruses and nucleic acid sequences to produce high levels of IFN\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1, which promote myeloid DC maturation. The in vitro model of porcine MoDC and NIPC employed in this study is proving of particular value in elucidating the processes involved, and its application in future studies investigating the innate immune response to pathogens should help identify optimised formulations for novel vaccine development and screening.",
