It is not clear, however, which infections are protective and whether some infections may in fact promote the development of atopy. The Th1/Th2 paradigm is central to hypotheses about the relationship between infections and the development of atopy. Th1 (CD4+) cells that primarily produce IFN-\u03b3 and interleukin-2 (IL-2) are involved in cell mediated immunity and inhibit B cell isotype switching to IgE production. Th2 cells produce interleukin-4 (IL-4), which promotes IgE production, interleukin-5 (IL-5), which is an important eosinophil growth factor, and IL-10, which is at least functionally a Th2 type cytokine because it inhibits IFN-\u03b3 production [5,6]. In theory, multiple infections early in life may enhance the development of Th1 type cells, thus protecting against further Th2 differentiation and possibly atopy.",

The minimum detection level for IL-10 was 4 pg/ml. IFN-\u03b3 levels were measured using Pelikine Compact\u2122 Human IFN-\u03b3 ELISA Kits (Pelikine, the Netherlands) which have a lower limit of detection of 4 pg/ml for IFN-\u03b3. For data analysis, cytokine levels higher than background readings but lower than the lower limit of detection were recorded as half the lower limit of detection.

It is likely, however, that IFN-\u03b1 was the interferon measured most easily, as reported in a subsequent study [21]. The lower airways of asthmatics have increased Th2 cytokines when compared with controls as measured in broncho-alveolar fluid [22,23]. Our study shows that the IFN-\u03b3 : IL-10 ratio is significantly lower in the respiratory tract secretions of babies who have RSV infection and that absolute IFN-\u03b3 concentrations are also lower when compared with babies where another virus or no virus is identified as a cause of respiratory tract symptoms. This suggests a suppression of Th1 cytokine responses at the respiratory tract level during RSV infections. It would also suggest that other viral infections, in particular rhinovirus, up-regulate IFN-\u03b3 production during acute infections. Moreover, our results did not demonstrate any differences in cytokine responses between atopic and non-atopic babies, which suggests that the cytokine response to RSV was not due to the babies' pre-existing atopic status.",

Renzi et al. [27] found that, of children hospitalized with acute RSV infection, those who developed asthma had significantly lower IFN-\u03b3 levels produced by their PBMCs at the time of the acute RSV infection than those with no asthma.

The authors concluded that RSV infection results in airway hyperresponsiveness in the acute phase and leads to changes in immune function that can enhance the effects of airway sensitization to antigen after infection [28]. In light of the animal model described, one can speculate that if a susceptible individual has RSV in early infancy and is exposed to an appropriate allergen at this critical time, their immune system may be more \u2018primed\u2019 to an atopic response.",

This raises the possibility that the pathogenesis of wheeze and perhaps asthma following RSV in susceptible individuals is related to the development of this cytokine profile in the respiratory tract.
