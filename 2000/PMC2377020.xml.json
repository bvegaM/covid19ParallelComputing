            "text": "This precursor plasmid vaccine construct (6438 bp) encodes the gag gene of the HXB2 strain of HIV-1 (Table 1). Briefly, it is built on the pVR1012x/s plasmid backbone containing a kanamycin resistance gene, the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter/enhancer (containing the immediate early 5\u2032 untranslated region and intron), and the bovine growth hormone (BGH) polyadenylation sequence. This backbone differs from a related backbone (Hartikka et al., 1996) used in products described below by removal of an XmnI site in the region following the BGH poly A sequence and replacement with an SfiI site. This was done to ensure that at least one SfiI site was present in each plasmid construct to permit use of SfiI in the integration studies. When the gene insert contained an SfiI site, the pVR1012 backbone was used. When it did not, the pVR1012x/s backbone, with the introduced SfiI site, was used. A synthetic version of the gag gene using codons optimized for expression in human cells was inserted into this plasmid backbone (pVR1012x/s). The nucleotide sequence of the synthetic gag gene shows little homology to the HXB2 gene, but the protein encoded is the same. This candidate vaccine did not enter clinical trials because development of multigenic constructs was pursued instead.\n",

To allow for the natural translational frameshifting, the synthetic coding region of the last four amino acids of the nucleocapsid protein through the rest of gag plus an additional three amino acids from pol were replaced with the authentic viral sequences from NL4-3. This introduces the site required for frameshifting and restores the ability to express all the gag proteins. Mutations were introduced into the protease-, RT-, and integrase-encoding sequences to destroy the biological activities of these viral proteins for safety while retaining the maximal number of potential epitopes for immunogenicity when inoculated into humans as a vaccine candidate (Huang et al., 2001). A phase I trial of this product was completed, and this product also served as a comparator plasmid for later products tested in biodistribution studies.",

VRC-2805 (6869 bp) consists of a HIV-1 clade B env gene inserted into the pVR1012x/s backbone, described above. The env gene contains the following modifications: a human codon\u2013optimized sequence from HXB2 into which sequences from BaL were inserted to change the tropism from the CCR4 receptor to the CXCR5 receptor. The chimeric env gene was truncated to include the entire SU protein\u2013coding region and a portion of TM, including the fusion domain, the transmembrane domain, and regions important for oligomerization. A portion of the fusion/cleavage domain has been deleted, as has been the interspace between heptads 1 and 2. This version of env is referred to as gp145\u0394cfi (Chakrabarti et al., 2002). VRC-4306 (9790 bp) encodes human codon\u2013optimized gag, pol, and nef genes expressed as a fusion protein. Deletions have been introduced into the protease-, RT-, and integrase-coding regions to destroy the biological activities of these viral proteins for safety reasons. In addition, the authentic viral sequences were included in the region to allow for frameshifting (as described above for Product 1 [HIV-1]). The gag portion of the fusion protein is from the HXB2 strain, and the pol and nef portions are from the NL4-3 strain (the entire nef including the initial ATG is included in the construct). This was inserted into the pVR1012 backbone. This HIV-1 clade B combination product was not tested in clinical trials on its own because a multiclade approach was chosen for clinical development. However, the two components of this vaccine candidate are included among the components of a product that proceeded into clinical trials (see description of Product 6 [HIV-1] below for more details).",

The stop codon TAG was removed from the gag-pol gene, and the nef gene from the same virus was ligated in. The fusion sequence was inserted into the pVR1012 backbone. VRC-5309 (6829 bp) consists of a human codon\u2013optimized gene encoding the env protein (modified as described for VRC-2805 to gp145\u0394cfi) from HIV-1 clade C 97ZA012 strain inserted into the pVR1012x/s backbone. VRC-4313 (9783 bp) consists of a human codon\u2013optimized gene encoding a gag-pol-nef fusion protein (modified as described for VRC-4306) from a HIV-1 clade A strain identified as GenBank accession number AF004885 (gag-pol) and AF069670 (nef) inserted in the pVR1012 backbone.

The basis for deciding to clinically develop this four-plasmid product instead of Product 6 (HIV-1) was as a result of murine (Kong et al., 2003) and nonhuman primate (NHP, unpublished data) immunogenicity studies. Further NHP studies led to the development of another six-plasmid product containing the CMV/R promoter (see below in Product 12 [Ebola] for description) and separating the gag, pol, and nef onto separate plasmids (Barouch et al., 2005). The preclinical studies described herein and in the companion article for Product 6 (HIV-1), as well as those for Product 12 (Ebola), along with phase I clinical data, supported the development of this newer generation six-plasmid product which has also entered phase I testing (Martin et al., 2005) and is proceeding into advanced clinical development as a prime for an adenovirus type 5-vectored boost HIV vaccine regimen.",

These studies have demonstrated that plasmid vaccines do not widely biodistribute and remain at the site of injection (the muscle and overlying subcutis). No differences were noted in these biodistribution and clearance patterns between genders. Furthermore, plasmid DNA is virtually never found in gonad specimens and in the sporadic cases where a signal was seen, it was very low (often nonquantifiable) and could be the result of inadvertent contamination in the course of collection of the tissues during necropsy despite scrupulous efforts to avoid it. These findings should allay the theoretical concerns that have been voiced about the potential for plasmid vaccine products to biodistribute to reproductive organs.",

Over the course of 2 months, all the inoculum clears from the muscle of most animals, and the few animals in which a signal remains, generally in the subcutis, the copy numbers are on the order of 102\u2013103 per microgram of DNA extracted from tissue. We do not at this point have data to explain why more plasmid remains in the subcutis/skin than in the muscle which receives the bolus of the inoculum. However, this phenomenon has been seen consistently in our data and that of others (personal communications, Chris Butler) whenever the subcutis/skin specimen has been tested. One possibility is that the subcutis/skin consists mainly of adipose tissues (cells which are large in comparison to the nuclei and which have large storage vacuoles) and cornified dermal layers (cells with no nuclei). It may be that the plasmid that remains has deposited into a portion of the cell (i.e., not the nucleus) in which, or outside of cells where, it does not get processed (i.e., expressed or degraded). We are considering further experiments to address this phenomenon.",

            "text": "One benefit of conducting these studies on an array of products is that it has provided eventual efficiencies in preparing regulatory submissions by providing more data on the safety and similarity of patterns of biodistribution of various candidate vaccines. These similarities are observed even with vaccines for differing disease indications, built on similar, although not identical, plasmid vaccine platforms. One example of this increased efficiency achieved is the continuous bridging of the biodistribution of newer generation products to an initial plasmid vaccine (Product 1 [HIV-1], a first-generation prototype), by including an arm in each new study for comparison to this product. Doing this has permitted bridging to an integration study and phase I clinical safety data, which had been obtained by the time of regulatory submission of the newer candidates. When biodistribution patterns and clearance patterns of a newer generation product were seen to be similar to Product 1 (HIV-1), even for another disease indication, integration studies were not required to be repeated for each candidate. As another example of this increased efficiency, although the product tested in Study D did not go forward to clinical trials, this study along with a toxicology study on the same product described in the companion article in this issue supported the conduct of clinical trials with two other products. One of these products is a subset of Product 6 (HIV-1, consisting of four of the six plasmids). The other product is another six-plasmid product, which consists of three plasmids (the clades A, B, and C env genes) expressing the same proteins and three plasmids expressing the clade B gag, pol, and nef genes on separate plasmids (rather than as a fusion protein). This newer generation six-plasmid product contains a different promoter (the CMV/R promoter) than the original Product 6 (HIV-1), but preclinical and clinical data from Product 12 (Ebola, also using the CMV/R promoter), the preclinical data for Product 6 (HIV-1), and the clinical data for the four-plasmid product supported the regulatory approval of the current six-plasmid construct without having to repeat preclinical biodistribution and repeated-dose toxicology studies. These regulatory efficiencies save months in the clinical development pathway of new candidate vaccines. Given the urgency of public health crises such as the HIV/AIDS epidemic with 14,000 new infections daily and the threat of global spread of newly emerging viral infections like SARS, this shortened development time is crucial.",

The primary difference that would be introduced in future integration studies would be to use a larger species (rabbits), so that doses more comparable to the human dose can be delivered and tissue specimens will be of sufficient size that they would not need to be pooled in order to get sufficient amounts of high-molecular weight DNA to perform the analyses.",

Thus, it should not be necessary to repeat biodistribution studies of newer vaccine candidates, if delivered i.m. by either of these devices. These studies have demonstrated that theoretical safety concerns expressed about DNA plasmid vaccines, e.g., that they might biodistribute to the gonads or that they might integrate, have not been borne out, when the vaccines were delivered i.m. with these devices. The data from these studies have been successfully used in submissions to a regulatory agency (U.S. FDA) to support the conduct of clinical trials with a number of vaccine candidates for differing disease indications (HIV-1, WNV, SARS, and Ebola).
