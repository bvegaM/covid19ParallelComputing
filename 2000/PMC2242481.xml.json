Research on the substrate specificity preferences of SARS-CoV 3CLpro is gaining increasing attention, owing to the biological significance of SARS-CoV 3CLpro in the viral life cycle and the feasibility to design specific SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors as potential anti-SARS drugs. It has been explicitly demonstrated that SARS-CoV 3CLpro cleaves the coronavirus replicase polyproteins at no less than 11 conserved sites, preferentially involving the Leu-Gln\u2193 sequence in the P2 and P1 positions at the cleavage site, respectively (Ziebuhr et al. 2000; Heygi and Ziebuhr 2002; Anand et al. 2003). To further extend our knowledge of the substrate specificity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, we aimed to comprehensively study the biological importance of amino acid residues in six selected positions (namely P2, P3, P4, P1\u2032, P2\u2032, and P3\u2032) flanking the conserved P1 position at the SARS-CoV 3CLpro cleavage site by a rapid and high-throughput approach (Table 1).",

Our peptide cleavage results indicated that only the peptide substrate with Phe replacement in the P2 position was also favorable for SARS-CoV 3CLpro cleavage (Fig. 1; Table 2), with similar total energy level (186.98 kcal/mol) in molecular docking when compared with the total energy of the positive control peptide (182.74 kcal/mol) with Leu in the P2 position. Also, the results of the three peptide batches (PS02\u20131, PS02\u20132, and PS02\u20133) in the secondary screening procedure further confirmed the results obtained from the primary screening procedure. The PS02\u20133 peptide batch showed that Ile was intolerant in the P2 position for SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Our results demonstrated consistency with other findings (Fan et al. 2004, 2005), suggesting that the P2 position serves as an important hydrophobic pocket for SARS-CoV 3CLpro-specific binding; thus, the peptide substrate with replacement of the original Leu with the hydrophobic Phe in the P2 position was still susceptible to SARS-CoV 3CLpro cleavage (Fig. 4). From the results of a previous time course cleavage experiment (data not shown), we observed that the SARS-CoV 3CLpro proteolytic cleavage rate of the positive control peptide was higher than that of the peptide with Phe substitution in the P2 position, which accounted for the dominant occurrence of Leu in the P2 position. Other studies also demonstrated that SARS-CoV 3CLpro favorably tolerates Phe and Val substitutions, and to a lesser extent, for Met and Ile substitutions in the P2 position (Fan et al. 2004, 2005), hence revealing the significance of the P2 hydrophobic pocket in the determination of SARS-CoV 3CLpro substrate specificity.",

            "text": "Furthermore, the P1\u2032 position, which is frequently occupied by Ser residue, also contributes to the substrate specificity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro considerably. Our peptide cleavage results revealed that the P1\u2032 position is highly unfavorable to the substitution by Pro, Asp, and Glu residues (Fig. 1; Table 2), which is consistent with molecular docking results showing their total energy levels being higher than that of the positive control peptide by more than fivefold. Our findings on the intolerance of Asp or Glu substitutions in the P1\u2032 position suggest that the acidic residues at the binding interface of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro active site are probably in close proximity and sterically complementary to the P1\u2032 position of the substrate, leading to electrostatic repulsions between the negatively charged acidic residues that hinder the substrate binding to SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Our molecular docking results also demonstrated that the P1\u2032 position is proximal to the Glu47 and Asp48 residues at the SARS-CoV 3CLpro active site (Fig. 4), which further confirmed our interpretations. Also, the unfavorable substitution by Pro in the P1\u2032 position could be accounted for by the steric hindrance arising from its cyclic side chain (Fig. 4), which obstructs the substrate binding to SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Previous studies also demonstrated that small aliphatic residues such as Ser, Ala, and Gly are favored in the P1\u2032 position (Fan et al. 2005).",

By combining the MALDI-TOF MS and synthetic peptide-based approaches, peptide-cleavage studies on the defined equal molar mixture of a batch of 20 peptide substrates before and after the protease cleavage reaction could be performed simultaneously on a single MALDI-TOF MS analysis. The MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer is a delicate and sensitive instrument that enables clear and precise discrimination of different peptides, even with single amino acid difference. Therefore, each of the 20 peptide substrates with equal molar ratios in the same mixture can be monitored simultaneously on a single MALDI-TOF MS analysis before and after the protease cleavage reaction. Our approach is advantageous over the traditional methods that are restricted to testing single peptides with defined condition one at a time and the setup of a total of 20 identical experimental conditions for every analysis. After generating the comprehensive cleavage profile on the 20 peptides simultaneously based on the primary screening procedure of the \u201ccartridge replacement\u201d strategy, we can easily identify some of the biologically important residues taking part in the recognition process. Nevertheless, we employed the secondary screening procedure using the defined batch-synthesis approach to synthesize target peptides in different batches for exact identification purpose (ambiguous residues like Ile/Leu and Gln/Lys that carry identical or close masses). Our approach provides an option in which the resolution of the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer instrument is not sensitive enough to distinguish between species with 1-Da mass difference. Also, MALDI-TOF MS analysis is tolerant to impurities; therefore, the reaction mixture can be analyzed directly after a simple desalting procedure, which reduces the workload of subsequent downstream purifications of cleavage products prior to analysis.",

The X-ray crystal structure of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro (1UK4) was downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (PDB; http://www.rcsb.org/pdb) and used as a starting model. The catalytic active site of chain A in the SARS-CoV 3CLpro structure without the bound CMK peptide was used in the study. Hydrogen atoms were added for the structure of SARS-CoV 3CLpro chain A using the BUILDER module. Then, the force field potentials and partial charges were assigned. The resulting structure was subsequently subjected to energy minimization using the DISCOVER module and was used as the initial structures for molecular docking. Since the proteolytic activity SARS-CoV 3CLpro mainly relies on the active nucleophile Cys145 and the acid-base catalyst His41, the region containing all residues (10.0 A radius) around this Cys\u2013His dyad was selected as the target site and was used to set up as a grid with the DOCKING module. The nonbond energies of this region were precalculated on the grid. Different peptide substrates were then docked into the target site by manual docking using the DOCKING module. The best docking position was based on the docking energy of the peptide/SARS-CoV 3CLpro complex. Thousands of orientations of peptides were searched by maneuvering in the Cys-His dyad region of SARS-CoV 3CLpro manually until reaching the energy minimum. The resultant complex was subjected to energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulation using the DISCOVER module. A dielectric constant of 1.0 was used throughout the energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulation. The system was equilibrated at 300 K for 100 psec, during which time the potential energy of the system reached a stable value. A time step of 1 fsec was used to integrate the equation of motion. The final conformation of the structure was obtained through 5000 iterations of steepest descent energy minimization. Ultimately, the total docking energy between the peptide substrate and SARS-CoV 3CLpro in the energy-minimized complex was calculated using the DOCKING module. The docking energy included the van der Waals and electrostatic energies, which were the components of the intermolecular energy.",
