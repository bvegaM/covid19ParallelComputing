            "text": "Bronchiolitis is the most common cause of infectious disease hospitalization among infants in the United States (1). Approximately 3% of children under the age of 1 year are hospitalized annually for bronchiolitis, and the cost of hospitalization is estimated to exceed $700 million (2, 3). Although bronchiolitis is a common disease that is readily diagnosed clinically, the standard of practice for diagnosis and management of bronchiolitis is still a source of debate. To address these concerns, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) developed and published a clinical practice guideline in 2006. This Guideline recommends that diagnosis be based on history and physical examination, and discourages virologic testing on the basis that results rarely impact management decisions. The Guideline states, however, that virologic testing may be useful when patient cohorting is possible (3).",

RSV is detected in 43\u201074% of cases of bronchiolitis, and parainfluenza (PIV), adenovirus and influenza are other commonly detected viruses (3, 5). The development of more sensitive diagnostic methods, such as polymerase chain reaction assays (PCR), has increased the number of viruses (e.g., human metapnuemovirus) detected in children with acute respiratory tract infections (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12). Most previous studies of respiratory viruses in children using molecular diagnostics have focused on children with a spectrum of respiratory tract infections some of which have been associated with acute wheezing (7, 8, 12). There have been few population\u2010based studies of children with bronchiolitis using molecular diagnostics (10, 11).",

Patient respiratory samples were later analysed by multiplex real\u2010time PCR without prior knowledge of the FA result for the following viruses: RSV, adenovirus, hMPV, coronavirus, PIV types 1\u20133, and influenza. PCR was performed on total nucleic acids isolated from frozen nasal wash samples using a previously described one\u2010step reverse\u2010transcription PCR master mix for RNA viruses and a master mix for adenovirus DNA (13, 14, 15). Primer and probe sequences were designed using Primer Express Software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) as previously described (13, 14, 15). Prior studies indicate that the FA and real\u2010time PCR viral testing was strongly correlated for both RSV and influenza. PCR was more sensitive than FA for PIV and adenovirus (13).",

Another study in infants with acute lower respiratory tract infections performed PCR on nasopharyngeal aspirates and detected viruses in 77% of patients (8). These studies found RSV to be the first (43.6%) or second (28%) most commonly detected virus, with rhinovirus (RV) being the second (31.8%) or first (32%) most frequent virus, respectively (7, 8).

The prevalence of co\u2010infections in other studies has ranged from 19\u201335% in young children with diverse types of respiratory tract infections seen in the hospital or emergency department (7, 8, 12). Of the published studies that use molecular diagnostics to report co\u2010infections in children with bronchiolitis, few analyse children diagnosed during an entire respiratory season. A study by Ong et al. of 50 infants with RSV bronchiolitis hospitalized during a one\u2010month period identified dual infection in 5 (10%) patients (9). A study by Greensill et al. of 30 infants with bronchiolitis requiring mechanical ventilation reported a 70% co\u2010infection rate among hMPV and RSV (16). A co\u2010infection rate of 9% was reported by Mansbach et al. in a multicentre study that sampled children with bronchiolitis for two to three\u2010week periods (10). Only one previous study was population\u2010based, representing a full viral respiratory season. This study, set in Greece, included 119 infants less than 1 year of age with bronchiolitis. Co\u2010infections were detected in 19.5% of children, 69% of which were dual infections between RSV and RV (11). In our study, we identified co\u2010infections in 41 (23%) children with bronchiolitis despite not testing for RV. In contrast to the studies by Ong and Greensill, our study population was larger, encompassed an entire respiratory season, and comprised patients discharged from the emergency department or admitted to a general pediatric floor or the intensive care unit.",

Many facilities use FA testing to direct cohorting, and Hall and Lieberthal emphasize that the rapid tests available are typically limited to RSV and influenza and perform with variable reliability (17). Using more sensitive assays, we found that of the 139 children with RSV detected, 34 (24%) were infected with another pathogen and most of these pathogens are not detected well or at all with current FA assays. Interpreting copathogen data with organisms such as coronavirus or adenovirus is problematic due to the difficulty in differentiating acute disease from long\u2010term shedding and the extent that bronchiolitis may be caused or exacerbated by these other viruses has not been definitively established. Our results suggest that the issue of viral testing merits further investigation as it has the potential to impact patient cohorting and management algorithms (18).",
