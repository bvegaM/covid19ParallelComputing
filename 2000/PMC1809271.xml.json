During the worldwide outbreaks of catastrophic SARS epidemic in 2003, SARS disease affected a cumulative number of 8098 subjects and claimed 774 deaths as recorded by the World Health Organization [3,4]. Clinically, SARS is characterized by persistent high fever (temperature >38\u00b0C), nonproductive cough or dyspnoea, rapidly progressing abnormal results on radiography and laboratory evidence of SARS-Cov RNA and existence of specific antibodies. Most of the SARS subjects exhibited a typical course of acute self-limited illness and around 10% died from SARS disease or associated complications [5]. To date, the considerable findings in early clinical manifestation, haematological, radiological, and microbilogical aspects have showed that SARS-Cov infection resulted in severe cytopathic changes [6\u20139]. The histological pathology in the lung of patients at autopsy, clinical manifestation and the abnormality showed by chest radiograph suggest that these changes are likely to be induced by the acute overwhelming immune response in vivo, but the underlying mechanism in the process of SARS-Cov infection is poorly understood yet [1, 5, 6].",

The CR1 gene is highly polymorphic with some single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites which may contribute to variation of E-CR1 expression. Interestingly, Wilson et al. identified the genomic Hind III restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) in intron 27 of the CR1 gene that, probably acting as a principle genetic polymorphism, had been found to correlate with E-CR1 expression in Caucasians. This gives rise to three genotypes including homozygosity of the HH (high) allele, heterozygosity of HL allele and homozygosity of the LL (low) allele that genetically regulate the high, intermediate and low expression of CR1, respectively [11]. E can bind complement opsonized microbe pathogens or immune complex (IC) through surface CR1 molecules and deliver them to tissue macrophages fixed at the reticuloendothelial system where they are eliminated [12]. As a result, CR1 on E (E-CR1) functions as one of the multiple components in host innate immunity and plays a crucial role against invading pathogens [13].",

Our previous work and other findings motivated us to seek how E-CR1 molecules in peripheral blood change in patients with SARS-Cov infection. To address the question, we longitudinally recorded the alteration of circulating E-CR1 expression throughout the course of SARS illness in 54 SARS patients. In addition, we simultaneously analysed the distribution of the Hind III expression polymorphism in the CR1 gene among the SARS patients and healthy individuals. Our findings suggest E-CR1 molecules, as one of the important components in innate immunity, are involved in the process of the deadly SARS disease.",

Briefly, EDTA-anticoagulated venous blood was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then layered onto a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient solution. After being centrifuged at 1000\u00d7 g for 10 min, erythrocytes were gently collected in the bottom layer and washed three times with saline. 106 cells were suspended in 50 \u00b5l of PBS plus 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incubated for 1 h at 4\u00b0C with 10 \u00b5l of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated mouse monoclonal antihuman CR1 antibody (E11 Clone, mouse IgG1) from BD-Pharmingen (Becton-Dickson, Mountain View, CA) [12,17]. As a control, 10 \u00b5l of mouse purified isotypic antibody conjugated with FITC or PBS were substituted for anti-CR1 antibody. After the samples had been washed, they were fixed with PBS containing BSA and 1% formaldehyde. Finally, the samples were subjected to immunofluorescent analysis in duplicate in FACScalibur (Becton-Dickson, Mountain View, CA, USA) within 12 h after fixation. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of stained erythrocytes (MFIs) and that of controls (MFIc) were measured using the Cellquest software program (Becton Dickinson). The degree of E-CR1 expression was estimated as the ratio of MFIs to MFIc (MFIs/MFIc) and was expressed as the net fluorescence intensity (NFI) according to the previous reports [15,23]. To confirm the reproducibility of E-CR1 measurements, the fluorescence intensity of FITC-conjugated Calibrite Beads was measured before FACS analysis every time on a separate day, the coefficient of variance of MFI of Calibrite Beads was within 3%.",

Our current observations confirmed a significant correlation between the Hind III RFLP and the relative expression of E-CR1 in Chinese Han ethnic population sample. This is consistent with an earlier report of 100 Southern Chinese and Taiwanese blood donors [27] and is also similar to results found in Caucasian populations. A recent study in Thailand also found a correlation between the Hind III RFLP and E-CR1 [28]. These findings further support the notion that variations of E-CR1 among healthy individuals are inherited and regulated by different HH, HL and LL genotypes [17,27]. We found that there was no significant difference in the frequency of HH, HL and LL genotypes between the SARS patients and healthy subjects in the Chinese Han population sample. Our limited data suggests that all the subjects have similar susceptibility to SARS viral infection. Unlike other complement regulatory proteins such as membrane control protein (MCP) and decay-accelerating factor (DAF), CR1 levels may have no direct influence on the ability of the virus to enter human target cells, and the viral replication process.",

Interestingly, we also found a significant decrease of E-CR1 in SARS patients, which may suggest an acquired deficiency of host innate immunity [13]. SARS-Cov viral loads may be an important factor in the decrease of E-CR1 since the early rapid decline and sequential persistent lower levels of E-CR1 occurred during the periods when SARS-Cov is positively detected in patient's plasma, sputum, throat swab and/or stool samples. In this way, SARS viral infection may induce the reduction or damage of innate immunity.",

The fluorescent density values of E-CR1 varies over a wide range for a definite genotype such as the HH, HL or LL alleles in various individuals, which may be influenced by the existing haplotypes as reported by Xiang et al.

This is probably occurring during the process of forming antibody-SARS antigens and complement immune complexes at the same time when the host produces the specific antibodies to the SARS antigens. The evidence that coexistence of the specific antibodies and the direct viral RNA was found in some patients supports this hypothesis. Therefore, the aetiology of the E-CR1 reduction may be associated with the removal of the immune complex (IC) by tissue macrophages during which CR1 is proteolytically cleaved from the surface of E though its underlying mechanism is still unknown.",

The different steroid regimens (doses ranging 80 mg \u2013480 mg each day) were empirically administrated for the treatment of SARS based on pneumonia severity as determined by chest radiograph examinations.

Therefore, our findings suggest that the E-CR1 density undergoes an acute but reversal decrease, which correlates with the initiation, progression and convalescence stages of SARS disease [13, 15, 32, 33]. The density of the E-CR1 molecules in patients during the convalescence stage increased to alomost as high a level as found in healthy subjects. This may be because the old erythrocytes with decreased density of CR1 molecules were gradually replaced by newly produced erythrocytes having normal density of E-CR1 molecules. This in turn increased the percentage of erythrocytes with normal density of E-CR1 molecules in the total peripheral population contributing to the slow rise of peripheral E-CR1 levels in SARS patients at convalescence stage. In fact, reticulocytes have shown to increase E-CR1 levels as compared to cells that have been in the circulatory system for a period of time (J.-M. Moulds, unpublished observation).",
