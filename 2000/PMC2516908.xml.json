Moreover, the blood brain barrier (BBB) restricts inflammatory leukocyte trafficking into the CNS [2, 3]. However, the CNS has the potential of developing efficient innate, adaptive, and regulatory immune responses. During neuroinflammatory disorders, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), the maintenance of this specialized environment is disturbed, and the loss of the BBB integrity is a critical event in disease pathogenesis. BBB disruption allows leukocytes to traverse the vessel wall, accumulate within perivascular spaces, and then progress across the glia limitans into the parenchyma to initiate a destructive inflammatory response [4]. These events are strictly regulated by adhesion molecules, chemokines, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [5, 6, 7].",

The Duffy antigen was named DARC after it was shown that it has the unusual capability to bind a broad spectrum of chemokines of CC and CXC subfamilies [17, 18]. DARC is expressed by endothelial cells [19, 20] and is accordingly involved in transferring chemokines across the endothelium, and as a result of the abundance red blood cells (RBCs), DARC is seen as a receptor involved in clearance of chemokines in the blood. D6 is an extremely promiscuous receptor [21], binding to at least 12 chemokines of the CC subfamily, all of which are inflammatory chemokines [13, 21]. Mice lacking D6 exhibited exaggerated, cutaneous, inflammatory responses and an increased susceptibility to the development of skin cancer [22]. Unexpectedly, D6\u2010deficient mice were also resistant to induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) as a result of impaired encephalitogenic responses [23]. Analyses of skin tissues at the immunization site in D6\n\u2212/\u2212 mice showed CD11c+ aggregates, suggesting that DC might be trapped at the site of antigen injection, therefore limiting antigen presentation [23].",

Fractalkine is a unique CNS chemokine present on neuronal membranes and capable of being released as a soluble protein by constitutive or stress\u2010activated a disintegrin and metalloproteinase\u2010family protease activity [27, 28, 29]. Fractalkine exerts its functions by binding to CX3CR1 on microglial cells. Although they are mainly produced in the CNS, fractalkine and CX3CR1 also have a distinctive peripheral pattern of expression. Fractalkine is found at low levels in endothelial and some epithelial cells of selected tissues such as kidney, lung, prostate, and heart but not spleen or liver [30]. CNS endothelial cells do not express fractalkine. Circulating monocytes and NK cells express CX3CR1 [31]. In our studies, we determined the levels of soluble fractalkine in the normal, healthy mouse brain, and we found that the levels of soluble fractalkine in wild\u2010type and Cx3cr1\n\u2013/\u2013 mice were dramatically different. Na\u00efve, CX3CR1\u2010deficient mice exhibited over 50 times more soluble fractalkine in the brain and in the serum compared with normal, wild\u2010type mice [32]. These observations led us to hypothesize that signaling chemokine receptors are required for ligand homeostasis. We continued our studies by determining the levels of ligands in various chemokine receptor\u2010deficient strains (Fig. 1). We analyzed mouse lines lacking chemokine receptors, including members from the CC and CXC receptor family, such as CCR2, CXCR2, and CXCR3, in addition to CX3CR1/CCR2 double\u2010deficient mice. These chemokine receptor\u2010deficient lines allowed us to determine the levels of constitutive ligands such as CX3CL1 and inflammatory ligands such as CCL2, CCL3, CXCL1, and CXCL10 in circulation (serum) and tissues during healthy conditions.",

Ccr2\n\u2013/\u2013 mice exhibited approximately three times more circulating CCL2 when compared with wild\u2010type. Cxcr2\n\u2013/\u2013 mice showed levels of circulating CXCL1 and CXCL2 that were more than 30\u2010fold increased when compared with wild\u2010type mice. Circulating levels of CXCL10 in na\u00efve, wild\u2010type and Cxcr3\n\u2013/\u2013 mice were undetectable. However, after inducing EAE, we found that Cxcr3\n\u2013/\u2013 mice exhibited significantly higher CXCL10 levels. Examination of chemokine levels in CNS tissues, where CX3CL1 and CXCL1 are expressed, also revealed that these ligands were significantly higher in Cx3cr1\n\u2212/\u2212 and Cxcr2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice, respectively, when compared with wild\u2010type mice [32]. Expression analysis showed that CX3CL1 mRNA levels were comparable in Cx3cr1\n\u2212/\u2212 and wild\u2010type mice, indicating that increased CX3CL1 was not caused by accumulation of mRNA. Reconstitution of CX3CR1\u2010 and CXCR2\u2010deficient mice with wild\u2010type bone marrow substantially restored chemokine homeostasis, supporting the notion that chemokines are cleared from the periphery and in some instances, from CNS tissue by cells expressing specific receptors [32]. The differences observed in ligand concentration in the various chemokine receptor\u2010deficient mice analyzed are not clear but might be a result of the degree of promiscuity of the receptor or the relative expression levels of ligand and alternate receptors.",

These highly regulated enzymes are implicated in a variety of physiological (angiogenesis, bone remodeling, etc.) and pathological processes, in particular, in the pathogenesis of CNS inflammatory disorders [37]. Increased expression of several MMPs has been found in the serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and CNS of MS patients [39]. Various MMPs are also increased in the CNS during experimental MS mouse models [40, 41]. In addition, intracerebral injection of MMPs to healthy mice induces BBB breakdown and leukocyte recruitment [42], whereas MMP inhibition blocks the onset or the development of EAE and even reverses the disease [43, 44]. Among the MMPs, MMP9 is of particular interest, as it is increased in the serum of MS patients, especially during clinical relapse, and correlates with disease activity on gadolinium\u2010enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging [45, 46]. Furthermore, young, MMP9\u2010deficient mice are resistant to EAE [47]. These findings implicate MMP9 in BBB disruption.",

Cornelia Bergmann and Steve Stohlman, we are evaluating the role of MMP9 in BBB disruption using the murine model of CNS demyelination induced by neurotropic coronavirus (JHMV) infection [48]. JHMV infection along with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) represent excellent viral models to study mechanisms involved in demyelinating diseases, such as MS. CNS infection with the neurotropic strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) induces an acute inflammatory response, followed by a chronic CNS infection with ongoing demyelination. In contrast to TMEV infection, infectious MHV remains undetectable during the chronic phase of JHMV infection, although viral antigens and RNA are present. Furthermore, chemokine and MMP expression during JHMV infection [48, 49] is well characterized and provides the basis to study individual factors contributing to parenchymal CNS infiltration by leukocytes. It is known that MMP9 protein levels are increased during JHMV infection [50], and this correlates with neutrophil recruitment. However, MMP9 mRNA is not altered, unlike MMP3 and MMP12 mRNA, which appear up\u2010regulated [49].",

Neutrophil depletion resulted in reduction of leukocytes in the brain, lessened BBB disruption, and absence of MMP9 activity, suggesting a role of this enzyme in BBB breakdown. However, a direct implication of MMP9 in mediating the loss of BBB integrity was not demonstrated. To address this question, MMP9\u2010deficient mice were infected with JHMV, and preliminary data revealed decreased leukocyte infiltration in infected Mmp9\n\u2212/\u2212 mice compared with wild\u2010type controls (C.

Previous studies [54] showed that JHMV infection in CCR2\u2010deficient mice was associated with increased mortality and absence of T cell infiltration, which are the primary effectors in viral clearance of infected CNS resident cells [55, 56]. The CCR2 ligand, CCL2, has also been implicated in chemoattraction of T cells to the inflamed CNS [57]. However, our preliminary results showed that migration of CD4 and CD8 T cells into the CNS of CCL2\u2010deficient mice was similar to control mice, suggesting that CCL2 is not implicated in CNS T cell recruitment during JHMV infection.

Second, the CXCR2 ligand CXCL1 expressed by reactive astrocytes at lesion edges [62, 63, 64] may arrest OPCs and block the remyelination process by precluding OPC entry into the lesions, thereby suppressing lesion repair. We proposed that EAE lesions might resolve more efficiently in mice lacking CXCR2 in the OPCs. We addressed this issue by constructing radiation bone marrow chimerae. Following sublethal irradiation, bone marrow from heterozygous mice was used for reconstitution, giving rise to chimeric Cxcr2\n+/\u2212 \u2192 Cxcr2\n+/+ and Cxcr2\n+/\u2212 \u2192 Cxcr2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice. Both of these chimeric mice express CXCR2 on hematopoietic cells, but Cxcr2\n+/\u2212 \u2192 Cxcr2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice selectively lack CXCR2 on OPCs (and other radio\u2010resistant cells). We found strong evidence that absence of CXCR2 in the CNS was associated with improved lesion repair in EAE. Cxcr2\n+/\u2212 \u2192 Cxcr2\n+/+ and Cxcr2\n+/\u2212 \u2192 Cxcr2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice had comparable incidence of EAE, indicating that loss of function of CXCR2 on leukocytes caused reduced incidence of EAE in Cxcr2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice. The day of onset, peak disease (reflecting kinetics of neurological impairment), and severity of EAE were all equivalent in both groups of mice. However, as seen previously in Cxcr2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice, the timing and extent of recovery were accelerated in mice lacking CXCR2 in the CNS. This result suggested that the absence of CXCR2 in the CNS led to improved repair of EAE lesions. This notion was supported by the observation that lesion size in Cxcr2\n+/\u2212 \u2192 Cxcr2\n+/+ and Cxcr2\n+/\u2212 \u2192 Cxcr2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice was comparable at the peak of EAE, correlating to the equivalent disease scores at this stage. However, during the recovery phase (10 days after onset of neurological signs), we found significantly smaller lesions in Cxcr2\n+/\u2212 \u2192 Cxcr2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice. Furthermore, after cuprizone intoxication, we found equal demyelination in Cxcr2\n+/\u2212\u2192 Cxcr2\n\u2212/\u2212 and Cxcr2\n+/\u2212 \u2192 Cxcr2\n+/+ mice at 4, 5, and 6 weeks after cuprizone treatment. However, Cxcr2\n+/\u2212 \u2192 Cxcr2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited enhanced remyelination 7 days after removing cuprizone compared with Cxcr2\n+/\u2212 \u2192 Cxcr2\n+/+ mice. A similar result was found after LPC injection (L. Liu, A. Belkadi, T. Hu, K. Choi, L. Darnall, R. H. Miller, R. M. Ransohoff, unpublished data). Therefore, blocking CXCR2 might confer neuroprotection and anti\u2010inflammatory effects.",

Previous studies [65, 66] demonstrated abnormal migration of cerebellar neurons in CXCR4\u2010 or CXCL12\u2010deficient mice, suggesting a role of the CXCL12\u2010CXCR4 axis in CNS development. Binding of CXCL12 to CXCR4 causes the activation of a series of downstream signaling pathways that regulates cell proliferation, migration, and survival in the CNS [67]. Recently, an orphan receptor, previously termed RDC1, was shown to be the second receptor for CXCL12, according to the gene structure, chromosomal location, and its high affinity to CXCL12 [68, 69]. This new chemokine receptor is now termed CXCR7. Interestingly, CXCL11, another CXC chemokine formerly known as IFN\u2010inducible T cell \u03b1 chemoattractant, can also bind CXCR7 with high affinity. Some of our efforts are concentrated in understanding the role of CXCR7 in the CNS in relationship to the various CXC ligands identified so far.",

Furthermore, it was demonstrated that CXCR7 is also expressed on tumor\u2010associated vasculature in breast and lung tumors. Enhanced expression of CXCR7 in tumor cells not only promotes tumor growth but also enhances the progression of metastases. It is plausible that CXCR7 works by sequestering CXCL11 or CXCL12 [74], making CXCR7 and CXCR4 potential targets for intervention in tumor biology. Of relevance, specific small molecular compounds for CXCR7 inhibited the growth of human tumor cells in mouse tumor models [69].

Hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and cerebellum of Cxcr7\n\u2212/\u2212 mice appeared normal.

These observations indicate that CXCR7 is not directly involved in neurogenesis. It is important to note that there are many developmental defects associated with CXCR4 deficiency; such defects include, among others, distorted laminar structure and abnormal migration of cells from the proliferative, external granule layer in the developing cerebellum, with establishment of proliferating aggregates and absence of foliation [65].",

All neuromasts originate from a migrating primordium, which moves from head to tail during the development of a lateral line. CXCR7 is expressed in the posterior\u2010lateral line, and a complementary expression pattern between CXCR7 and CXCR4 was described. In particular, expression of CXCR7 is strong in the posterior part but absent in the leading half of primordium, and expression of CXCR4 is mainly detected in the leading part of primordium [75, 76]. Morpholino knockdown of CXCR7 leads to the deficient migration of primordium that eventually affects the distribution of neuromasts. Other studies also support this observation by showing that antisense knockdown of CXCR7 specifically affects the migration of trailing cells, resulting in tissue stretching [76]. Further studies are needed to delineate in detail the downstream mechanisms of CXCR7 during mammalian development.",

However, using three different in vivo models, we found that reconstitution of CXCR2 on hematopoietic cells \u201crescued\u201d demyelination. Blockade of CXCR2 might promote remyelination in MS lesions, as well as reducing inflammation. Therefore, blocking CXCR2 might confer neuroprotection and anti\u2010inflammatory effects. Among therapeutic strategies under investigation for treatment of MS, several groups focus on preventing leukocyte infiltration within the CNS. MMP9, by its implication in BBB disruption, constitutes a potential and promising target for MS treatment (Fig. 1). Moreover, treatment of EAE with MMP inhibitors showed interesting findings, but some of these inhibitors were then abandoned because of side\u2010effects as a result of the lack of inhibitor selectivity [78, 79, 80]. Indeed, MMPs can also display beneficial roles, particularly in tissue repair [81]. Regarding these data, it is important to know the exact role and source of MMPs during MS pathogenesis, before using MMP inhibitor treatment. Our data, by demonstrating a direct effect of MMP9 in BBB disruption and identifying which cell type is implicated in MMP9 release, would bring additional information essential for potential MS therapeutic strategies. CXCR7 and CXCR4 are also targets for inhibition for clinical intervention, particularly in cancer biology. Our efforts are concentrated in defining the specific actions of chemokine receptors in the brain and their linkage with peripheral elements during neuroinflammatory conditions with the hope that successful clinical, therapeutic approaches might be developed.",
