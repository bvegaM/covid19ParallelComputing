We used the macrophage/microglia marker F4/80 to identify the location and number of these cells in the white matter of chimeras with IFN-\u03b3-sufficient or -deficient T cells. Consistent with previous studies of JHM-induced demyelination,20,25,26 IFN-\u03b3-sufficient chimeras had infiltration of macrophages/microglia into the white matter in areas of demyelination (Figure 1, A and B). IFN-\u03b3-deficient chimeras, however, had limited macrophage/microglia infiltration into the spinal cord. These areas may represent sites of incipient myelin destruction, although little frank demyelination was detected (Figure 1, E and F). Demyelination occurred in the vicinity of virus-infected cells. However, virus antigen was not found in areas of demyelination, suggesting that myelin destruction occurred during the process of virus clearance. (Figure 1, C and G).",

These cytokines are produced by T cells in response to specific activation through recognition of cognate peptide by the TCR.27 As expected, IFN-\u03b3 was expressed only by transgenic CD8 T cells harvested from recipients of IFN-\u03b3+/+ bone marrow (Figure 2, A and E). There was a similar frequency and number of activated cells in both IFN-\u03b3-sufficient and -deficient chimeras as measured by TNF-\u03b1 staining (Figure 2, B and F; Table 1). Therefore, we conclude that the production of IFN-\u03b3 by specifically activated cells, and not merely activation of T cells, is responsible for bystander demyelination in this system. Additionally, there were no CD8 T cells specific for the immunodominant epitope of JHM (residues 510\u2013518 of the spike glycoprotein) in any mice tested (Figure 2, C, D, G, H). A recent study28 demonstrated that, even in the absence of cognate antigen in the CNS, activated CD8 T cells could infiltrate the CNS, with subsequent activation of microglia. We were able to detect activated P14 T cells in the CNS of CFA:gp33-treated mice, in the absence of JHM infection, although there were roughly six-fold fewer T cells in the CNS of uninfected mice than in their JHM-infected counterparts (data not shown). However, in this model system, we were unable to find histological evidence of macrophage/microglia activation or demyelination in the absence of JHM infection (Figure 1, I and J).",

Furthermore, this approach did not compromise IFN-\u03b3 production by cells such as NK cells and dendritic cells, thereby preserving the innate immune response to the virus.24,29 The results showed that IFN-\u03b3 produced by these innate cells was unable to initiate the demyelinating process, even in the context of activated CD8 T cells lacking only the ability to produce IFN-\u03b3.",

These results highlight the important role that CD8 T cells have in demyelination in JHM-infected mice. IFN-\u03b3 has also been shown to be critical in other models of demyelination and in MS. In rodents with EAE induced by CD8 T cells specific for a CNS antigen, demyelination is greatly diminished in the absence of IFN-\u03b3.30 In all cases, the presence of CD8 T-cell-produced IFN-\u03b3 results in increased macrophage/microglia infiltration into the white matter, with subsequent demyelination. Similarly, CD8 T cells are abundant in MS lesions31 and treatment with anti-IFN-\u03b3 antibody appeared to reduce disability in a small (n = 15 patients receiving treatment) clinical trial.32 Consistent with these data, administration of IFN-\u03b3 to patients with MS resulted in disease exacerbation.33 In patients with MS, the source of the IFN-\u03b3 that leads to disease exacerbation is unknown, but based on our results, it may be from CD8 T cells responding to an intercurrent infection. From our results, it appears that IFN-\u03b3 and not any other cytokine or chemokine was the key mediator of bystander demyelination (Figure 3). However, because our screen for chemokines and cytokines was not exhaustive, it is possible that other soluble factors were affected by the presence or absence of CD8 T-lymphocyte-produced IFN-\u03b3. Alternatively, differences in local concentration of chemokines or cytokines may be critical in the demyelinating process and might not be evident in this assay. It is also possible that IFN-\u03b3 affects the functions of non-soluble molecules that may be involved in macrophage/microglia activation.",
