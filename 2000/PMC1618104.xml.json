            "text": "Viruses of the plus-strand (+) RNA Coronaviridae family employ the largest multicistronic RNA genome composed of a single segment of 27\u201332 kb. This family includes the Coronavirus and Torovirus genera that together with the distantly related Arteriviridae and Roniviridae families form the Nidovirales order (Gonzalez et al, 2003; Draker et al, 2006 and reviewed in Lai and Holmes, 2001; Siddell et al, 2005). The coronavirus genome RNA is translated to express the two most 5\u2032 open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, occupying approximately two-thirds of the genome. They encode major subunits of a poorly characterized membrane-bound complex that mediates the synthesis of the genome RNA (replication) and numerous subgenomic RNAs (transcription) (Gorbalenya, 2001; Thiel et al, 2001; Gosert et al, 2002; Prentice et al, 2004; Ziebuhr, 2005). ORF1a encodes the replicative polyprotein (pp) 1a, and ORFs 1a and 1b together encode pp1ab. Expression of the ORF1b requires a \u20131 ribosomal frameshift just upstream of the ORF1a stop codon. The two polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab are autocatalytically processed by at least two proteases to produce up to 16 end products called non-structural proteins (nsp) 1 to 16, as well as multiple processing intermediates (Thiel et al, 2003). The central and C-proximal regions of the polyproteins are processed at 11 conserved sites by the chymotrypsin-like proteinase known also as main proteinase (Mpro) that resides in nsp5 (reviewed in Ziebuhr et al, 2000).",

Replicase polyproteins of nidoviruses share a conserved array of functional domains (from the N- to C-termini): Mpro, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (Cheng et al, 2005), zinc-binding domain-containing helicase (ZBD-HEL) (Ivanov et al, 2004b) and uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) (Bhardwaj et al, 2004; Ivanov et al, 2004a). In coronaviruses, RdRp, ZBD-HEL and NendoU reside in nsp12, nsp13 and nsp15, respectively. In large nidoviruses, such as corona-, toro- and roniviruses, the conserved replicase polyprotein backbone is elaborated with additional enzymatic domains, including an exoribonuclease (ExoN) (Snijder et al, 2003; Minskaia et al, 2006) and a putative ribose-2\u2032-O-methyltransferase (Feder et al, 2003; Snijder et al, 2003), which in coronaviruses, reside in nsp14 and nsp16, respectively. Despite recent progress in the characterization of replicase proteins, a large fraction of these proteins encoded in ORF1a (nsp1, nsp2, some nsp3 domains, nsp4, nsp6, nsp7, nsp8 and nsp10) remains functionally poorly characterized.",

            "text": "The crystal structure of a complex between the 197 a.a. nsp8 and the 83 a.a. nsp7 protein was recently determined for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Zhai et al, 2005). It revealed a hexadecamer in which eight nsp7 molecules act as a mortar that holds the nsp8 octamer. RNA binding experiments with these subunits and the overall architecture of the complex suggest that the later encircles RNA. These authors have proposed that this complex provides a platform that might confer processivity to the synthesis of large RNAs in coronavirus nsp12 RdRp-mediated replication and transcription. This RdRp is phylogenetically clustered with RdRps of (+) RNA viruses whose genome RNAs have the 5\u2032-end covalently linked to a viral protein genome-linked (VPg) (Koonin, 1991). For the well-studied poliovirus RdRp, covalent (oligo)nucleotide\u2013VPg complex serves as a primer to direct the template-dependent synthesis of RNAs by RdRp (Paul et al, 1998). RdRps of the VPg-containing viruses share a conserved sequence motif G that was implicated in the recognition of primer\u2013template RNA complex (Barrette-Ng et al, 2002; Gorbalenya et al, 2002; Thompson and Peersen, 2004). The motif G was also identified in RdRps of coronaviruses (Gorbalenya et al, 2002), and accordingly, the SARS-CoV RdRp was shown to be primer-dependent (Cheng et al, 2005). Since the 5\u2032-end of genome RNA of coronaviruses is blocked by a cap rather than a VPg (Siddell et al, 2005), these data indicate that coronaviruses may have evolved a special mechanism to generate primers used in RNA synthesis.",

However in the profile searches, we observed an under-the-threshold hit with an equivalently located region in the ORF1a-encoded polyprotein of the Breda bovine torovirus (BToV-1) (Draker et al, 2006). In the torovirus pp1a/pp1ab polyproteins, this region is flanked by two potential 3CL cleavage sites, which may be recognized by Mpro (Figure 1 and AE Gorbalenya, personal communication). These data indicate that the identified region may be a very distant ortholog of nsp8. An alignment of coronavirus nsp8 and the putative BToV-1 ortholog identified eight absolutely conserved residues, which include Lys-58, Lys-82 and Ser-85 (Figure 1).",

A weak polymerization with poly(rU) template and no activity using poly(rA) template were observed (data not shown). A strong activity using poly(rC) and oligo(rC15) template (Figure 2) was detected, with a linear polymerase activity after up to 4 h of incubation, in a template-dependent manner. The activity was found to be manganese-dependent, although magnesium but not Zn2+, Co2+ nor Ca2+ could also promote RdRp activity with a much lower efficiency (Supplementary Figure 1B). Nsp8 preparations are insensitive to rifampicin, a potent Escherichia coli RNA polymerase inhibitor. Nsp8 polymerase activity is free of contaminating or intrinsic terminal transferase (TNTase) activity. Indeed, a TNTase activity assay carried out with 5\u2032-labeled oligo(rC15) and unlabeled guanine triphosphates as substrates shows no ladder-like products above the labeled oligo(rC15) template (data not shown). The RdRp activity was blocked by mutations at the most conserved positions of nsp8 (see below). Thus, the RdRp activity is catalyzed by nsp8 rather than a co-purified protein.",

Elongation of the labeled primers by nsp8 was not detected (not shown). An ability of the nsp8 RdRp to synthesize RNA in the primer-independent mode was compared to well-established primer-independent RdRps, the HCV NS5B and the Dengue virus (DV) NS5 (Ackermann and Padmanabhan, 2001; Kao et al, 2001). In this assay, an oligonucleotide of 15 consecutive cytidines (oligo(rC15) and GTP) were used as the template and the sole nucleotide substrate, respectively, to direct RNA synthesis. Figure 2 shows the synthesis of oligo(rG) products for each polymerase. The size pattern of products synthesized by nsp8 is similar to those that were produced using HCV NS5B and, to a lesser extent, DV NS5. In the reactions catalyzed by either nsp8 or HCV NS5B, a similar pattern of products up to 7-mers was found. The most prominent was the accumulation of pppGpG, which is a hallmark of a kinetic limitation in the initiation step of RNA synthesis. However and in contrast to NS5B and NS5, nsp8 was unable to catalyze the synthesis of the full-length complementary copies of the template. The seemingly full-length products are shorter and accumulated to a lesser extent than those produced by HCV NS5B or DV NS5. These results indicate that nsp8 is an RNA-directed, primer-independent RdRp acting in a distributive fashion.",

A significant nsp8 RdRp activity was only detected using poly(rC) template. Since poly(rG) template generates strong secondary structures, it cannot be tested in a similar polymerase assay. To analyze whether guanines could be part of a template for nsp8, the heteropolymeric RNA template, 5\u2032-UAU AAU GGA AAA-3\u2032 (oligo 5), containing two internal guanines, was tested. No nsp8 RdRp activity was detected using this template. Based on these and other experiments (see below), we concluded that the template must contain at least one cytosine to promote RNA synthesis by nsp8. A 373-nt heteropolymeric RNA template identical to a part of the SARS-CoV genome was used to monitor RdRp activity, and the results are presented in Figure 3A. Nsp8 is able to synthesize only short RNA products (<6-mers), whereas HCV NS5B RdRp is able to synthesize both short and long products. The nsp8 heterogeneous product profile suggests various internal initiation sites (see below). Various short synthetic RNA oligonucleotides were then designed to refine relevant template requirements for an efficient synthesis of RNA products by nsp8 (Table I).",

The RdRp specific activity of these mutants was measured using [3\u2212H]GTP incorporation into RNA using a poly(rC) template, and was expressed as a percentage of the activity of the wild-type nsp8 (Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure 3). The K58A, R75A, K82A and S85A mutations abolished or greatly reduced the RdRp activity. The nsp8 RdRp activity was most sensitive to replacement of either of the three residues, K58, K82 and S85, which are also conserved in the torovirus sequence. The D161A mutant remains substantially active. Although the nsp8 activity is metal-ion dependent, there are no essential and conserved acidic residues that may chelate a catalytic Mn2+ (see Discussion). Activities recorded with the nsp8 mutants are thus fully consistent with the alignment presented in Figure 1.",

We have superimposed the RNP motifs of nsp8 head domain onto the RNP motifs of hnRNP D. In this superimposition, the ssRNA is stacked by the hydrophobic surface of the two RNP motifs and points towards the inner part of the hexadecamer channel (Figure 6B). Thus, while an nsp8 molecule of the hexadecamer stacks the RNA template (Figure 6A, represented in black), a second is able to bind the nascent primer. Then, the two first NTPs incorporated (GTP in +1 and CTP in +2) are bound to two strictly conserved basic residues Arg-75 and Lys-82 present on the second nsp8 molecule (Figure 6A, represented in clear gray). The positioning of the GTP primer against the helix implies that triphosphated dimers and longer primers would not fit into the active site, consistent with the fact that they are not elongated.",

These RdRps are distinguished by the presence of the G sequence motif that was implicated in the primer/template recognition (Gorbalenya et al, 2002). Relevance of these observations for coronaviruses may be linked to the finding that the SARS-CoV nsp12 RdRp is active, in vitro, using a poly(rA)/oligo(dT)12\u221218 primer-template (Cheng et al, 2005). Since coronaviruses may not produce VPg, the identity of a primer and the mechanism of its generation have remained unresolved for these viruses. Besides VPg, cellular RNA molecules are recruited by some RNA viruses to prime polynucleotide synthesis in either replication or transcription of the genome. This strategy was adopted by influenza viruses and retroviruses, which either hijack a piece of a cellular mRNA (Plotch et al, 1981) or use a tRNA (Mak and Kleiman, 1997), respectively, as a primer. We propose that coronaviruses have evolved another strategy to produce primers, which may use the newly identified nsp8 RdRp as the primase.",

Recent analysis indicates that it is likely to include virus-encoded RNA processing enzymes ExoN (nsp14), EndoU (nsp15), and a putative ribose-2\u2032-O-methyltransferase (nsp16) (Snijder et al, 2003; Bhardwaj et al, 2004; Ivanov et al, 2004a; Ziebuhr, 2005; Minskaia et al, 2006), which could excise primers synthesized by the low-fidelity nsp8 RdRp (with a misincorporation rate of 1/10 as a lower limit). This excision could be part of the methyl directed-mismatch repair activity that is worth further testing. Similarly to the E. coli and eukaryotic primases, the nsp8 RdRp exhibits a limited processivity. The prokaryotic DNA primases (i.e., from the E. coli DnaG family) generally recognize specific sequences on the template (Yoda et al, 1988), while eukaryotic primases are sequence-independent (Bullock et al, 1994). The SARS-CoV nsp8 revealed marked sequence preferences and, like cellular primases, RNA synthesis starts with a purine residue. Once the nsp8/RNA/nucleotides ternary complex has been formed, a rate-limiting step occurs before or during dinucleotide synthesis, a feature that is also common for cellular primases. In our hands, nsp8 and the purified nsp7\u2013nsp8 complex exhibit comparable activities (not shown). The only noticeable biochemical difference between nsp8 and the nsp8\u2013nsp7 complex, which may be the functional form of the nsp8 RdRp, is a relatively poor thermal stability of nsp8 (data not shown). Remarkably, this property was predicted upon examination of the crystal structure of the nsp8\u2013nsp7 complex by Zhai et al (2005), who described nsp7 as a \u2018mortar' protein.",

Our preliminary results show that in agreement with the reported results and the proposed model, purified nsp8 and nsp12 interact in GST-pull down experiments (Imbert et al, unpublished data). The 3- to 5-fold excess of the nsp8 synthesis relative to nsp12, due to downregulation of the latter by frameshifting (Brierley, 1995; Thiel et al, 2003), seems to be used to build the nsp7/nsp8 octamer complex containing four nsp8 subunits (Zhai et al, 2005). Consequently, equimolar stoichometric ratio between interacting nsp8 and nsp12 species may be maintained in the infected cell. The nsp8 has a unique bi-domain structure that is different from those of prokaryotic and eukaryotic primases. Its C-terminal domain has a fold also found both in a diverse family of RNA-binding proteins and the catalytic palm-subdomain of RdRps (Hansen et al, 1997; see Supplementary Figure 5). This finding indicates that the nsp8 RdRp and nsp12 RdRp may have originated from a common ancestor, possibly through a duplication during evolution leading to the emergence of the ancestral virus of the Coronaviridae family. Previously, duplications of PLpro and Mpro were implicated in the evolution of the coronavirus proteome (Ziebuhr et al, 2001).",

Three polar and essential residues, Lys-58, Lys-82 and Ser-85, which may be part of the catalytic residues network for the phosphoryl transfer reaction, are located in the N-terminal domain. As in the case of the coronavirus Mn2+-dependent endonuclease nsp15, the metal-ion dependence in catalysis remains undefined and is unlikely to be promoted by acidic residues. However, our tertiary structure modeling analysis further suggests that the highly conserved Trp-182 in the C-terminal domain (head domain) is close to the \u03b1-phosphate of the +2 nucleotide and might be involved in Mn2+ coordination promoting metal-based nucleophilic activation at the phosphorus center. Indeed, such interaction between aromatic residues and cation, termed cation\u2013\u03c0 (Dougherty, 1996), have been described as a non-covalent bonding interaction relevant for molecular recognition and catalysis (Zaric et al, 2000). A role for Trp-182 in catalysis is consistent with the fact that in the putative torovirus ortholog, the residue is also an aromatic residue (Tyr). Regardless of the precise composition of the catalytic center of nsp8, it differs from that conserved in the nsp12 RdRp, impeding to determine undoubtedly if these two RdRps have been acquired independently or have diverged profoundly.",

This alignment and individual nsp8 sequences were used to search sequence databases as described in Snijder et al (2003). Using results of these searches, the original alignment was extended to a distantly related (see text) torovirus sequence using the MUSCLE program. The resulting alignment was converted into this figure using the ESPript program, version 2.2 (http://espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/cgi-bin/ESPript.cgi). Residues that are conserved in all or >70% sequences are boxed in red and yellow, respectively.
