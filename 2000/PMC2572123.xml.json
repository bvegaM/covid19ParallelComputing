The ability to identify quickly the causative pathogen of an emerging epidemic or pandemic markedly increases the chances of success of any countermeasures to contain the disease. For this reason, many countries together with the World Health Organization (WHO; Switzerland, Geneva) have made great efforts to develop integrated surveillance networks for tracking candidate pathogens\u2014such as the bird influenza virus H5N1, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), West Nile virus, poliovirus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis\u2014and to keep tabs on their genetic structure, geographical distribution and host populations. Moreover, recent advances in molecular biology\u2014DNA chip or new sequencing technologies, for example\u2014are continually improving the diagnosis of a wide range of pathogens and their variants.",

Phase four would be sustained human-to-human spread. In that event we would try to ring fence that event by antivirals and vaccines.\u201d H5N1 is now out of control among domestic chickens in many developing countries and is endemic among wild duck populations in parts of Asia.",

This RNA virus is spread by mosquitoes and affects birds in particular, although it can also infect several mammalian species, including horses and humans. In an optimal host, such as the robin or crow, the virus multiplies to sufficiently high titres to make the blood taken by biting mosquitoes infectious to their next victim. However, the virus cannot accumulate so readily in mammals, meaning that their blood is not infectious and thereby making them viral \u2018dead ends'. As such, birds are the worst affected with high death rates, although the death toll in mammals is also serious\u2014West Nile virus causes fatality rates of between 3% and 15% in humans. Yet, as Daszak noted, the fact that birds suffer most severely can help to identify areas of risk in sufficient time for people to take precautions. \u201cThe birds are the first to die off and act as a good sentinel for human infections\u201d, he commented. Even if West Nile virus is not yet a major threat to humans, it could still mutate into a more virulent form or, although it is much less likely, one that is transmissible directly without needing a vector.",

RNA was extracted from tissue taken from the patients and was sequenced to yield 103,632 RNA fragments. This set was narrowed down to 94,043 by eliminating highly repetitive sequences, and algorithms were then applied to eliminate sequences that were known to be unique to vertebrates, to assemble the small components into larger contiguous components and then to compare these with sequence motifs in microbial databases. The sequence analyser BLASTX (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/) finally revealed 14 protein fragments that were consistent with the genus of Old World arenaviruses, which includes the species responsible for Lassa fever (Palacios et al, 2008).
