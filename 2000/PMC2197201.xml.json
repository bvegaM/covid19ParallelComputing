            "text": "Intron-encoded small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that play essential roles in eukaryotes and archaea. They are transcribed as longer precursors and are generally released through splicing (reviewed by Filipowicz & Pogacic, 2002 \u25b6). Nevertheless, some snoRNAs can also be processed by endonucleolytic cleavage in the intron sequences flanking the snoRNA (Fragapane et al., 1993 \u25b6). XendoU is the first endoribonuclease involved in the processing of snoRNAs in higher eukaryotes to be described and is involved in the processing of at least two snoRNAs in Xenopus laevis oocytes (Fragapane et al., 1993 \u25b6; Caffarelli et al., 1994 \u25b6; Renzi et al., 2002 \u25b6; Laneve et al., 2003 \u25b6). It is a U-specific enzyme that, uniquely among known endoribonucleases, releases 2\u2032-3\u2032 cyclic phosphate termini using Mn2+ as an essential cofactor. XendoU is conserved among higher eukaryotes and has no homology to any known cellular ribonuclease, although it shows significant homology to proteins tentatively annotated as serine proteases. A viral counterpart of XendoU, called NendoU, has been reported. It is a distinctive marker of the nidoviruses, which include the SARS coronavirus (Snijder et al., 2003 \u25b6): the SARS homologue shows biochemical characteristics that are similar to those of XendoU, although it prefers double-stranded substrates, and is essential in virus replication and transcription (Ivanov et al., 2004 \u25b6). XendoU was isolated from a cDNA bank, cloned with an extra 12 N-terminal amino acids including a non-cleavable His6 tag, expressed in bacteria, affinity purified and tested for activity in vitro (Laneve et al., 2003 \u25b6). Mutational studies allowed the identification of the residues (Glu161, Glu167, His162, His178 and Lys224) essential for RNA cleavage, while enzyme\u2013RNA interaction assays led to the definition of the sequence required for Mn2+-independent binding (Gioia et al., 2005 \u25b6).",

In order to obtain large amounts of protein for crystallization screening, XendoU was overexpressed in bacteria [Escherichia coli M15 (pREP4) strain] in LB medium at 303 K to an optical density (OD600nm) of 0.55 and was induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl \u03b2-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) for 4 h with continuous agitation and good aeration. Subsequent manipulations were carried out at 277 K. Harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Na/phosphate pH 7.8, 300 mM NaCl), 10 mM imidazole and 1 mg ml\u22121 lysozyme while stirring for 2 h. After sonication, the cell lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 18 000g and the clear supernatant was filtered (0.2 \u00b5m filter, Sartorius) and applied onto a 5 ml Ni\u2013NTA column (Amersham) previously equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed with 1 l washing buffer 1 (10 mM HEPES pH 7.8, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole) and 30 ml buffer 2 (10 mM HEPES pH 7.8, 50 mM NaCl, 75 mM imidazole). The protein was eluted in 10 mM HEPES pH 7.8, 50 mM NaCl, 100 mM imidazole. Repeated steps of ultrafiltration and dilution across 10 kDa cutoff filters (Vivascience) eliminated the imidazole. The His-tagged protein was purified by HPLC gel filtration using a polymeric resin gel (PWXL-G3000 60 cm \u00d7 17 mm column; Tosoh Biosciences) and concentrated to 0.5 mM (17 mg ml\u22121) in 10 mM HEPES pH 7.8, 50 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA. SDS\u2013PAGE analysis showed a protein purity of greater than 95%.",

The supernatant from the cell lysate was applied onto a glutathione-derivatized column (FFT-GST; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with lysis buffer (10 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 7.8, 50 mM NaCl). The column was washed with 30 volumes of washing buffer 1 (10 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 7.8, 300 mM NaCl) and ten volumes of washing buffer 2 (10 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 7.8, 50 mM NaCl) and subsequently incubated with bovine thrombin (Sigma; 0.5 U per milligram of protein) at 277 K overnight to allow tag proteolysis on the column. A FFT-PABA-derivatized resin column (Amersham) that binds proteases using the protease inhibitor para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) was connected in line with the FFT-GST column. A single elution step allowed the thrombin to be retained on the PABA column and the untagged protein to be recovered in the flowthrough.

To overcome the spot overlap arising from the long c axis, the radiation wavelength was increased to 1.2 \u00c5, the crystal-to-detector distance was increased to 210.00 mm and diffraction images were collected with a thin oscillation range (\u0394\u03d5 = 0.4\u00b0).

Monoclinic crystals in fact displayed at least two different unit cells (A and B forms). Different protocols of dehydration and iterated cryocooling techniques did not improve either the anisotropy or the resolution limit (Samygina et al., 2000 \u25b6).",

To obtain monodisperse protein, several conditions were explored. Only the addition of chelating agents (100 mM imidazole or 20 mM EDTA) yielded homogeneously disperse protein. We attributed the polydispersity to the formation of intermolecular bridges between His tags mediated by divalent metal ions present as contaminants. Consistently, the addition of Mn2+ to a protein preparation which had been made monomeric using EDTA was sufficient to induce aggregation again (Fig. 1 \u25b6).",

Analytic HPLC gel filtration both on methacrylate and on silica gel showed the protein to be completely monodisperse even after addition of Mn2+, thus demonstrating that aggregation was dependent on the His tag and not on other metal-binding sites on XendoU.",

In summary, it was possible to reverse the aggregation mediated by the His tag through the addition of EDTA or imidazole, allowing the growth of crystals suitable for structural analysis. Use of chelating agents would be a less expensive and time-consuming alternative to specific proteolytic cleavage of the His-tagged protein, which in the case of XendoU was not effective for crystal improvement. This information may be valuable especially in high-throughput structural projects, where a large number of proteins are expressed, purified and screened for crystallization.",
