Initially, a recombinant reporter construct consisting of Ub fused to the amino terminus of mouse soluble PLA2 group X was expressed and purified. In addition, the core catalytic domain of the isopeptidase USP2a/2b (hereafter referred to as USP2) was overexpressed as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli.",

Furthermore, the cleavage of Ub-PLA2 was dose dependent as detected by the liberation of the fluorophore 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD) from 2-(6-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)hexanoyl-1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (NBD C6-HPC) (Fig. 2C; Supplemental Fig. S1). The initial lag in the cleavage of the PLA2 substrate NBD C6-HPC is partially due to the coupled nature of the USP2, Ub-PLA2 assay. To determine if the fluorescent readout of the assay accurately reflected USP2 activity, the fluorescence intensity was fitted to a fourth-order polynomial equation (Fig. 2D). When the x\n2 factor was plotted against USP2 concentration, a very strong linear relationship was revealed, confirming the dose dependency of the assay (see Discussion). An additional DUB, USP7, was expressed and purified from Sf9 insect cells, and a similar linear relationship was observed when 0\u2013160 nM USP7 was incubated with 30 nM Ub-PLA2 and 20 \u03bcM NBD C6-HPC (Supplemental Fig. S2). Thus, the DUB, Ub-PLA2 assay can be used to monitor dose-dependent DUB activity.",

As expected, USP2, USP5, USP7, USP8, and USP15 were primarily deubiquitinating enzymes. Consistent with published reports, USP5 cleavage of Ub-PLA2 was significantly enhanced by incubating in the presence of 25\u2013100 nM mono Ub (Supplemental Fig. S3; Dang et al. 1998; Reyes-Turcu et al. 2006). Similarly, the mammalian and yeast deSUMOylases SENP2 core and ULP1 core were confirmed to be deSUMOylases, and the deNEDDylating enzyme DEN1 to be a deNEDDylase. SARS-CoV PLpro core and UBP43 were both preferentially deISGylases. As reported previously, PLpro also had some DUB activity; however, when equimolar amounts of Ub-PLA2 and ISG15-PLA2 were tested concurrently, PLpro generated a much stronger signal with the ISG15-PLA2 than with the Ub-PLA2 reporter (Barretto et al. 2005; Lindner et al. 2005, 2007). Interestingly, the selectivity data suggested that 20 nM NL63 PLP2 was able to cleave 30 nM Ub-PLA2 or 30 nM ISG15-PLA2 with similar efficiency (Table 1). We were unable to determine Km values of PLP2 for Ub and ISG15-PLA2 due to a lack of saturable kinetics (data not shown). However, when compared at a lower concentration (1 nM) with 30 nM of UBL-PLA2, a twofold higher signal was observed when PLP2 was incubated with Ub-PLA2 relative to ISG15-PLA2 (Fig. 3). In contrast, the fluorescent readout for 1 nM PLpro + ISG15-PLA2 was 3.8-fold greater relative to Ub-PLA2 (Fig. 3). As expected, the relative fluorescence unit (RFU) value was enhanced 17-fold for USP2 and Ub-PLA2 (vs. ISG15-PLA2).",

The UCH-L3 enzyme was highly active as demonstrated by its ability to cleave the alternative reporter, Ub-AMC (Supplemental Fig. S4). Our data are consistent with the observation that ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases such as UCH-L3 preferentially cleave Ub from small adducts (exemplified by Ub-AMC) (Larsen et al. 1998). In addition, 20 nM JOSD2, a member of the Machado\u2013Joseph disease domain subfamily of DUBs, was unable to cleave 30 nM of any of the UBL-PLA2 reporter fusion proteins as detected by PLA2 activity. However, higher concentrations of JOSD2 cleaved Ub-PLA2 (Supplemental Fig. S5A). Comparable results were seen with Ub-AMC, suggesting that JOSD2 is a relatively weak DUB or exhibits substrate specificity (Supplemental Fig. S5B). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the UBL-PLA2 assay format has utility as a tool to dissect the specificities of purified isopeptidases.",

            "text": "We wished to determine the relative activity of the UBL-PLA2 system in comparison to other isopeptidase reporter assays. When equimolar concentrations of Ub-PLA2 and Ub-AMC were directly compared, low (12.5\u201350 nM) concentrations of Ub-PLA2 were found to produce significantly higher signal-to-background (S/B) ratios than the same concentrations of Ub-AMC (Supplemental Fig. S6). One application of isopeptidase reporters is the discovery and characterization of novel isopeptidase inhibitors. Prior to screening for inhibitors, we determined the assay robustness and reproducibility in a HTS format, designated by the Z\u2032 value (Zhang et al. 1999). The USP2, Ub-PLA2 assay exceeded the Z\u2032 value required for a usable HTS assay (0.5) with a Z\u2032 value of 0.72 \u00b1 0.04 (Supplemental Table 1; Supplemental Fig. S7). To test whether the Ub-PLA2 reporter system was capable of identifying an inhibitor of USP2, the EC50 value of the well-characterized DUB inhibitor, ubiquitin aldehyde (Ub-ald), against USP2 was determined using 27.2 nM Ub-PLA2/20 \u03bcM NBD C6-HPC or 316 nM Ub-AMC (Fig. 4). Comparable EC50 values were obtained for Ub-ald mediated inhibition of USP2 as measured by Ub-PLA2/NBD C6-HPC (363 \u00b1 50 nM) or Ub-AMC (473 \u00b1 103 nM). The Lanthascreen DUB substrate represents an alternative reporter system for measuring DUB activity. Direct comparison revealed that for the USPs tested, the Ub-PLA2 assay was significantly more sensitive (Supplemental Fig. S8). Additional applications of the UBL-PLA2 assay platform include measuring the isopeptidase activity of crude cell lysates and monitoring partial fractionation schemes from HeLa cells or Sf9 cells (Supplemental Fig. S9A,B). The observed isopeptidase activities were inhibited by nonspecific sulfhydryl alkylating agent N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM), confirming that the assay measured cysteine protease activity (Supplemental Fig. S9C) (data not shown). These data confirm that UBL-PLA2 is a sensitive reporter system that has utility to measure activity of crude cell lysates in addition to purified proteins.",

To further characterize NSC 632839 against purified enzymes, we determined its inhibitory potential against purified USP2, USP7, and SENP2 and demonstrated that NSC 632839 was not only a DUB inhibitor, but also a deSUMOylase inhibitor (Fig. 5A\u2013C).

Importantly, NSC 632839 did not inhibit the reporter enzyme PLA2 over the concentration range tested (1.2\u2013150 \u03bcM), indicating that the reported inhibition was selective for isopeptidases (Fig. 5D). As expected, NEM inhibited USP2, USP7, and SENP2 with EC50 values of 1.9 \u00b1 0.2 mM, 1.4 \u00b1 0.07 mM, and 1.3 \u00b1 0.2 mM, respectively (Fig. 5A\u2013C). NEM does not inhibit PLA2 over the concentration range tested (0.2\u201325 mM) (data not shown). Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) inhibited the Ca2+-dependent PLA2 enzyme (in the presence of 2 mM CaCl2) with an EC50 value of 2.5 \u00b1 0.006 mM (Fig. 5D).",

Thus, the Ub-PLA2 fusion protein linked by an \u03b1-peptide bond is appropriate for monitoring purified DUB activity. The shape of the progress curves such as Figure 2C is due to several factors. First, there will be a lag in fluorescence appearance due to the coupled nature of the assay, and this is further complicated by the fact that the substrate for PLA2 is largely micellar, requiring bulk transport of monomeric substrate before the PLA2 can act. Thus, the use of a polynomial fit is purely phenomenological. The apparent relationship between the x\n2 factor and enzyme amount may arise from the fact that [E] and [S] are similar in these assays. This means that the concentration of the ES complex leading to product formation will be determined by the fact that [ES] = [E] \u00d7 [S], and since [E] \u223c [S], then [ES] \u223c [E]2.",

USP5 activity was enhanced in the presence of exogenous Ub (Supplemental Fig. S3), consistent with its known specificity for polyubiquitin (Dang et al. 1998; Reyes-Turcu et al. 2006). In contrast, the Ub-PLA2 assay does not appear to be appropriate for measuring the activity of UCH enzymes such as UCH-L3. The Ub-PLA2 assay also had low activity against a member of the Machado\u2013Joseph disease domain proteases. However, it should be noted that at higher concentrations of JOSD2, dose-dependent DUB activity was observed; a similar observation was made for JOSD2 with Ub-AMC (Supplemental Fig. S5). Interestingly, the relatively poor in vitro cleavage of Ub conjugates by JOSD2 is consistent with a previous report of another member of the Machado\u2013Joseph domain, Ataxin 3 (Mao et al. 2005).",

In addition, in our hands PLpro is a deISGylase (Table 1; Fig. 3). Moreover, our data are in agreement with the very recent report that SARS Co-V PLpro functioned preferentially as a deISGylase (Lindner et al. 2007). In contrast, 20 nM of the related NL63 coronavirus protease (PLP2) appeared to cleave both Ub and ISG15 conjugates equally well when tested against 30 nM Ub-PLA2 or 30 nM ISG15-PLA2. Follow-up experiments demonstrated that lower concentrations of PLP2 (1 nM) were able to generate a significantly greater signal when incubated with Ub-PLA2 relative to ISG15-PLA2 suggesting that PLP2 has a preference for Ub relative to ISG15 (Fig. 3). Confirmatory kinetic experiments were uninformative due to a lack of substrate saturation (data not shown).",

In contrast, we did not detect any significant enzymatic deISGylating activity for USP2 or USP5 (Table 1). Previously, the same group described the ability of USP5 to bind ISG15-vinyl sulfone, but to our knowledge the enzymatic cleavage of ISG15 conjugates by USP5 has not been demonstrated (Hemelaar et al. 2004).

In contrast to Ub-AMC and Lanthascreen DUB substrate, in the Ub-PLA2 assay, the DUB cleaves a 14-kDa protein from the C terminus of Ub, likely representing a more physiological substrate for DUBs such as USP7 (Layfield et al. 1999). In addition, although Ub-AMC has been used to screen for inhibitors, its excitation wavelength is in the UV range, which is known to result in false positive rates as high as 20% in HTS (Liu et al. 2003; Tirat et al. 2005). Importantly, comparable EC50 values were obtained for the inhibition of USP2 by the specific DUB inhibitor Ub-ald as detected by Ub-PLA2/NBD C6-HPC or Ub-AMC, illustrating that the Ub-PLA2 assay is appropriate for screening for inhibitors of isopeptidases (Fig. 4). Further, the utility of the Ub-PLA2 assay as a HTS screening platform for modulators of isopeptidase activity is illustrated by the assay exhibiting Z\u2032 values ranging from 0.69 to 0.92 (Supplemental Table 1; Supplemental Fig. S7). As in the case of all coupled enzyme assays, there is the possibility that a compound will directly modulate the activity of PLA2; these compounds, however, can be rapidly eliminated by a counterscreen against free PLA2 (Fig. 5D). Taken together, these data demonstrate that with respect to the most numerous class of DUBs, the USPs, the Ub-PLA2 assay is ideal for determining relative enzyme activity. In contrast, Ub-AMC and the Lanthascreen DUB substrate seem better suited to the UCH family of DUBs.",

            "text": "In summary, data presented within have demonstrated that the UBL-PLA2 reporter assay is a robust and sensitive assay. Further, as exemplified by PLpro and PLP2, the same platform can be used to discriminate DUB, deSUMOylase, deISGylase, and deNEDDylase activities. As such, the UBL-PLA2 reporter system is beginning to provide new mechanistic insights in the field of UBL isopeptidases. Furthermore, additional reporter fusions consisting of alternative reporter enzymes that require a free amino terminus for activity fused to UBLs are currently in development (data not shown). Isopeptidases are clearly an emerging disease target, and we propose that the UBL-PLA2 reporter system will be an extremely useful tool to identify novel inhibitors and activators of target USPs (Nicholson et al. 2007). We estimate that >500,000 datapoints have been generated against \u223c40 therapeutically important isopeptidases using the current assay in 96- to 1536-well-plate formats. Importantly, when screened in a 1536-well-plate format, the assay exceeded a throughput of 400,000 data points per day with a Z\u2032 value of 0.73 \u00b1 0.27 (PubChem AID 927; H. Veith and D. Auld, pers. comm.). These results show that the assay is robust, and data describing the results of this and other screening campaigns will be the subject of future publications.",
