This size was determined by the known mRNA sequence that contains exon I and II (4.4 kb) plus an intron sequence of 2.2 kb. Exon II encodes for the last 235 amino acids of the HFGL2 protein and contains the 3\u2032 UTR.

The polyadenylation (polyA) site identified at position 1476 most likely gives rise to transcription termination that leads to the shorter 1.5-kb message. A 282-nucleotide long Alu element, starting at position 1655, has technically challenged our cloning of the distal end of the 3\u2032 UTR of HFGL2. A possible polyA signal further downstream in the yet to be cloned region of the HFGL2, probably gives rise to the 4.4-kb mRNA. Our Northern blot studies show that the presence of the two mRNA species is tissue dependent (Figure 2, A and B) \u25b6 . For example, in tissues such as the colon, small intestine, stomach, and prostate the 4.4-kb mRNA predominates. However, in tissues such as the ovary, the 1.5-kb mRNA transcript is expressed predominantly, whereas in the spleen, uterus, skeletal muscle, and peripheral blood leukocytes, the two mRNA transcripts are present in near equal amounts (Figure 2, A and B) \u25b6 .

The 225 amino acids at the carboxyl end corresponds to the well-conserved fibrinogen-related domain. 2  The five potential glycosylation sites are conserved in the mouse and human proteins. A cDNA of HFGL2, encompassing the entire coding region, was cloned into pcDNA3.1-His and expressed as a fusion protein (phfgl2his) in CHO cells (Figure 3B) \u25b6 . Three hfgl2 specific proteins were detected (200, 140, and 62 kd) by immunoblotting, suggesting that the encoded protein is a dimer or trimer composed of 65-kd subunits joined by disulfide bonds. These results are consistent with a previous report. 14  Transient transfection of CHO cells with a full-length cDNA of the HFGL2 coding region resulted in the expression of a procoagulant activity which accelerated the clotting time of recalcified plasma (Table 1) \u25b6 . The high level of procoagulant activity coincided with the expression of a prothrombinase which directly cleaved prothrombin to thrombin (Figure 4) \u25b6 . This data strongly supports the hypothesis that like its murine counterpart, the HFGL2 gene encodes a prothrombinase activity.",

In six instances, there were surviving areas of parenchyma comprising less than 40% of the liver. These areas typically showed earlier stages of active hepatitis with focal, confluent, or bridging necrosis (Figure 5) \u25b6 . In two instances, the entire liver showed end-stage liver disease with total panlobular necrosis. All were examined by in situ hybridization for the presence of HFGL2 prothrombinase mRNA transcripts and by immunohistochemical methods for CD68-positive macrophages or histiocytes as well as fibrin. In the four cases in which surviving parenchyma was seen, fgl2 prothrombinase RNA was detected in macrophages in association with fibrin deposits in vascular sinusoids located selectively in the areas of acute focal, confluent, or bridging necrosis but was infrequent or absent in the more advanced areas of panlobular necrosis in which only the consequences of the active hepatocellular necrotizing process remained. Fibrin deposits were observed by immunoperoxidase staining with an antibody specific for fibrinogen and fibrin, and fibrin thrombi in sinusoids were confirmed by electron microscopy. Panels A to E in Figure 5 \u25b6  are all from areas of residual parenchyma to show regions of bridging necrosis and for comparison, a large area of complete hepatic necrosis and collapse. Panels D and E are deeper sections of the same block that are matched to show equivalent areas of acute bridging necrosis. The positive cells (dark blue stained cells) in the in situ micrograph (E) correspond to the large macrophages (CD68-positive cells) in micrograph (D). Panel C (electron micrograph) is also from an area of acute bridging necrosis.",

First is the isolation and characterization of the HFGL2 prothrombinase gene that encodes for a prothrombinase having procoagulant activity with the ability to directly cleave prothrombin to thrombin. The second is the co-localization of the HFGL2 prothrombinase gene expression in macrophages and fibrin deposition in sinusoids with microvascular thrombosis and hepatocellular necrosis in the most hepatitic lesions in fulminant viral hepatitis. These observations are key to the pathogenesis of the rapidly progressive necrosis in this disease. The fact that HFGL2 and fibrin are not seen in the more advanced lesions may be attributed to the transitory nature of the immune coagulation response and the rapidity of the hepatocellular necrotizing process that rapidly results in end-stage necrosis of the liver.",

Progression ensued by further fibrin deposition and arrest of sinusoidal blood flow leading to the rapid development of confluent multicellular hepatic necrosis resulting in fulminant hepatic failure and death in 4 days. 4  There is strong evidence for implicating fgl2 prothrombinase as pivotal in the pathogenesis of this disease in the mouse model: levels of this prothrombinase activity correlate with the severity of the disease; 16,17  and there is concordance between expression of fgl2 prothrombinase in the liver with fibrin deposition; and neutralizing antibodies attenuate the pathological and clinical manifestations. 5  Indeed, it is not the viral load that determines the occurrence of massive necrosis but the viral induced up-regulation of the fgl2 gene which initiates the pathological process. 5,18  Although, treatment with neutralizing antibodies to the fgl2 gene abrogates the disease, a high viral load persists. 5  Fulminant murine hepatitis and fgl2 gene expression were shown to be genetically linked and it is likely that host genetic factors are also important in human fulminant hepatitis. 19 ",

The reason for not finding fibrin may be attributed to its transient nature as reported here, and also the lack of precision of the histological methodologies used to detect fibrin in tissues. It is also pertinent to mention here that other investigators have cloned and sequenced HFGL2 and termed it musfblp in the mouse 35  and fibroleukin in humans. 36  Both groups isolated the molecule from T lymphocytes and postulated its role as an extracellular matrix protein important in regulatory T-cell activation. It is also important to note that other molecules with homology to fgl2 such as cytotaxin 37  or tenascin, 38  have potent immunoregulatory effects on T cells. Thus, expression of HFGL2 may explain accumulation of inflammatory cells in areas of liver injury and immunological disturbances that may contribute to the hepatic necrosis. Preliminary results from our laboratory have shown that recombinant fgl2 is a potent inhibitor of mixed lymphocyte reaction and cytotoxic T cell responses (work in progress). These findings may explain the immunosuppressant status and inability to clear the virus in patients and mice with fulminant hepatic failure.",

            "text": "The amino acid sequence suggests that both HFGL2 and fgl2 are either secreted or type II transmembrane proteins. Ruegg and Pytela 6  have suggested that HFGL2 is a secreted protein. However, further analysis of the sequence suggests that the protein is a type II transmembrane protein. This is based on the fact that the region from position 3 to 23 is hydrophobic. This 21-amino acid log stretch is sufficiently long enough to span the layered phospholipid cell membrane. Furthermore, the amino terminus has a tendency to maintain a helical configuration characteristic of transmembrane domains. 39  Previously, we reported that fgl2 was a serine protease based on inhibition studies with diisopropyl fluorophosphate and other serine protease inhibitors. 40  Unlike the serine proteases of the coagulation cascade with the catalytic domain GDSGG, belonging to clan SA, HFGL2 could belong to clan SE serine protease with the active site motif S..K. The motifs at positions 91 and 142 could potentially serve as the catalytic sites. Preliminary data using site-directed mutagenesis suggest that the motif at position 91 is the active catalytic domain (unpublished data). After the cystein at position 213, the rest of the carboxyl end of the HFGL2 protein consists of a domain homologous to the FREDs (fibrinogen related domain) which is found on a number of different proteins with functional diversity. Examples of these proteins are the three chains of fibrinogen, tenacin, ficolin, and HFREP-1. 41-43 ",

The viral induced up-regulation of the fgl2 gene and the potent prothrombinase molecule it encodes plays a pivotal role in initiating the immunothrombotic microcirculatory changes that lead to the rapidly spreading necrosis. Thus, there is a causal link between fgl2 gene up-regulation that initiates immune coagulation and the transient but devastating microthrombosis in sinusoids resulting in rapid, progressive, and widespread hepatocellular necrosis both in humans and in mice. Having established this relationship, the provocative and exciting findings of successful abrogation of the lethal effects of the fgl2 gene in murine fulminant viral hepatitis offers the potential for developing methods for attenuating the disease in man.",
