These processes are expensive, laborious and risky because of the need to grow and handle large quantities of infectious virus. Therefore, the inactive virus strategy is limited in its applications by safety considerations. In contrast, the subunit vaccine is a safer approach. The most important advantage of subunit vaccine is that the infectious virus can be entirely excluded from vaccine production, and consequently the risks associated with the production and reversion to virulent genotypes can be entirely eliminated. However, some subunit vaccines based on recombinant proteins are poorly immunogenic because of incorrect folding of the target protein or poor presentation to the immune system. As a specific class of subunit vaccine, VLP-based vaccines are currently under investigation for several human viruses, such as papillomavirus,21 bluetongue virus,22 hepatitis virus,23 rotavirus24 and influenza virus.25,26 These studies demonstrate that VLPs offer a promising approach to recombinant vaccine development because of their robust immunogenicity, their ability to elicit protective neutralizing antibodies and their advantageous safety profiles.",

So far, more than 30 different VLPs of human and animal viruses, including SARS CoV, have been obtained.27,28 The VLPs are used to investigate virus assembly, protein interaction, vaccines, and as delivery vectors. The current study investigated the assembly of SARS CoV VLPs in insect cells using recombinant baculoviruses. We constructed recombinant baculoviruses containing the SARS CoV E and M genes, and then infected insect cells to examine the minimum requirements for VLP formation. Our results showed that the E and M proteins coexpressed in insect cells generated VLPs, which exhibited spheriform structures resembling SARS CoV virions. This phenomenon resembles the findings of previous studies on other coronaviruses.12 In our study, we used VLPs not only to investigate the assembly and budding of SARS CoV particles but also to determine the possibility of their application as a SARS CoV vaccine. Therefore, we intended to incorporate the S protein into VLPs. The S protein is the receptor binding protein, playing a crucial role in viral infection, and it is the main target for neutralizing antibody vaccine design. Upon coinfecting insect cells with vAcME and vAcS, we demonstrated that SARS CoV VLPs formed and were visible in infected cells when viewed under a electron microscope. To confirm that the S protein is incorporated into the VLPs, the VLPs were examined under the electron microscope by immunogold labelling. The electron microscope results showed that VLPs were tagged along with gold-conjugated immunoglobulin G, indicating that S proteins were assembled into the VLPs. Successful incorporation of the S protein onto the surface of the VLPs makes it possible to use such VLPs as vaccines against SARS CoV.",
