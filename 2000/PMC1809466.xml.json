Nevertheless, murine CoV infection induces autoreactive T cells, B cell polyclonal activation, and autoAb production [22\u201324].

Sera of some patients were collected two or three times at the late stage; in all, 60 serum samples from 41 patients were tested. Eight serum samples from patients diagnosed with pneumonia from non-SARS aetiology (obtained from Dr T. R.

Algorithms for immunogenicity, second-structure prediction, protein topology analysis, and hydrophobicity were applied to design the tested peptides. The protein sequence of spike protein was obtained from GenBank (accession number AY274119). Immunogenic viral peptides were calculated based on the algorithm developed by Kolaskar and Tongaonkar [27]. In-silico secondary structural analyses of spike protein were performed based on two algorithms: PHD and PREDATOR. Protein topology prediction was based on the algorithm developed by TMHMM. Hydrophobic moment of the peptides was calculated based on the algorithm HMOMENT. Similarity searches were performed between spike protein and human genome databases using the NCBI Blastp program. For blastp analysis, the default database collection of all nonredundant GenBank cDNA sequence translations, PDB, SwissProt, PIR and PRF entries was used, with the species restricted to human. Finally, expert curation was applied for refinement on peptide design. Multiple antigen peptides were synthesized by CytoMol Corp. (Mountain View, CA, USA). Several synthetic peptides were used in this study: D02 (residues 658\u2013669, N-ASYHTVSLLRSTSQK-C), D03 (residues 733\u2013744, N-EEGNLLLQYGSFCTQ-C), D07 (residues 927\u2013937, N-GLGKLQDVVNQNGE-C), and D08 (residues 942\u2013951, N-ALNTLVKQLSSN-C).

Complement inactivation of patient sera was performed before experiments. Therefore, epithelial cell injury must have been mediated by patient IgG via a complement-independent pathway. However, the possibility that complement-mediated cytotoxicity may play a role cannot be excluded.

Because a cytokine storm such as the increased production of IFN-\u03b3 was previously shown [26], the adhesion of PBMC to IFN-\u03b3-treated A549 cells in the presence or absence of anti-S2 Abs was also assessed. Results showed that higher levels of PBMC adherence could be observed in cells treated with IFN-\u03b3 for 24 h compared to the untreated group (Fig. 5a). Interestingly, anti-S2 promoted the adhesion of PBMC to A549 cells and this was greatly enhanced in combination with IFN-\u03b3 treatment (Fig. 5a). Therefore, in addition to cell injury after cross-linking, anti-S2 Abs can also up-regulate the immune cell adhesion to epithelial cells. Study using immunostaining indicated that monocytes in PBMC were the major cell population with preferential binding to the anti-S2-treated A549 cells (data not shown). This is in accordance with the finding that macrophages are the prominent leucocyte in the alveoli of SARS patients [12]. In a competition binding assay, synthetic peptides (D07 and D08) and S2 protein inhibited the anti-S2-mediated adhesion of PBMCs to A549 cells (Fig. 5b).",

Among the changes observed in the lungs of SARS patients are epithelial cell proliferation and desquamation, hyaline membrane formation along alveolar walls, and immune cell infiltration during the early stage of the disease, and increased fibrosis and multinucleated epithelial giant cell formation during a later stage. The increasing viral load suggests an effect caused by viral replication in the early phase [11]. In addition, proinflammatory cytokine production and dysregulation may be involved in the pathogenesis of SARS [12, 15, 16, 26]. One study documented IgG seroconversion in 93% of the patients at a mean of 20 days. The timing of IgG seroconversion, which started on day 10, correlated with falls in viral load, which occurred between days 10\u201315, when several clinical worsenings, which cannot be explained by uncontrolled viral replication, occurred. The lung damage at this phase is therefore related to immune-mediated pathological effects [11]. In the present study, we showed that autoAb production is also involved in SARS-CoV infection. The autoAbs, mainly IgG, started to appear on day 20.",

            "text": "Viral infections have been associated with the development of autoimmune diseases [30]. Most autoimmune disorders are chronic diseases, but there are several acute autoimmune responses that are initiated shortly after infection. Structural similarities between viral proteins and self-antigens have long been proposed as targets for immune cross-reactivity associated with the initiation of autoimmunity. We have reported this phenomenon in dengue virus infection and hypothesized its role in the immunopathogenesis of dengue virus-induced dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome [31\u201334]. Our finding that antiepithelial cell autoAbs are produced after SARS-CoV infection is another example of acute viral infection-induced autoimmunity. Both viruses have some characteristics in common: both are lymphotrophic; the infections cause high fever, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, haemorrhage, and mild hepatitis; cytokine storm occurs in the acute phase; and molecular mimicry exists between virus proteins and self-antigens. Mouse CoV infection induces B cell polyclonal activation and the generation of autoAbs [23,24]. Although autoAb production in SARS patients causes cytotoxicity to A549 cells (type-2 pneumocytes), whether the autoimmune response may act as a pathological factor in SARS disease needs further investigation. Interestingly, the elevated Ab titre was associated with the aggravation of respiratory failure [35]. In addition to Ab-mediated cytotoxicity, the release of chemokines and cytokines by A549 cells has been detected. Our preliminary results indicated an increase in the production of IL-6, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2 after anti-S2 stimulation (unpublished data).",

The neutralizing effect of anti-SARS-CoV spike Abs was demonstrated. Based on our results by sequence comparison from the NCBI protein database, however, several regions of SARS-CoV spike protein show sequence homology to self-antigens expressed in human cells. We have identified several candidate proteins recognized by SARS patient sera and anti-SARS-CoV spike Abs, including annexin II, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, albumin, \u03b11-antitrypsin, aldo-keto reductase, and transferrin (manuscript in preparation). The local alignment by Java-European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite (JEMBOSS)-Water analysis showed that these proteins have a high degree of homology with the spike peptide sequences of D07 and D08 located in S2 portion. Recombinant S2 protein or the spike peptides D07 and D08 blocked the binding of SARS patient sera to A549 cells. Furthermore, murine anti-S2, but not S1, antisera can bind A549 cells. These results suggest that anti-SARS-CoV Abs can recognize the cross-reactive epitope on human lung epithelial A549-cell proteins by molecular mimicry between spike proteins and self-antigens. The epitope for neutralizing Abs is in the S1 domain [38,39], while the cross-reactive Abs recognize the epitope on the S2 domain of spike protein. Analysis of Ab expression profile from SARS patient sera used in this study indicated that anti-S2 IgG started to appear around day 20, while antinucleocapsid (N) IgG could be detected around day 10 [40]. This is consistent with the previous report that IgG seroconversion started on day 10 [11] and with our findings that the autoAbs, which are mainly anti-S2 IgG, appeared on day 20.",

It is still not clear why intense lung inflammation develops even after the viral load has dropped two weeks after the onset of fever. The virus itself and virus-induced cytokine production might be responsible for the early stage of lung epithelial cell damage, while the late autoAb-mediated or infiltrating cell-mediated inflammation causes continued and sustained alveolar damage and fibrosis. In addition to A549 cells, other cell types, including endothelial cells, hepatocytes, and fibroblasts, were also bound by autoAbs in SARS patients. The autoAb production caused by the molecular mimicry between self-antigens and the spike protein of SARS-CoV might relate to the systemic effects and the sequelae of SARS disease [41]. Furthermore, the binding of immune cells with lung epithelial cells, which is accelerated by the combination of IFN-\u03b3 and anti-S2, may contribute to the inflammatory responses associated with SARS pathogenesis. This hypothesis needs to be further tested. Studies on the role of autoAbs will be crucial to gain an insight into SARS immunopathologic mechanism.",
