Although many studies of memory T cells have focused on those derived from the spleen and/or extralymphoid organs such as the gut, we and others have observed that memory T cells are found in the bone marrow.15\u201321 In particular, we showed that antigen-specific CD8 T cells can still be detected in the bone marrow for several months after immunization.21 Thus the capacity of CD8 T cells to migrate to the bone marrow and assume long-term residence in this site may be an important aspect of immunological memory. Here we have investigated whether migration to the bone marrow is restricted to memory CD8 T cells or whether it is also a property of antigen-specific CD4 T cells. Additionally, we have undertaken adoptive transfer experiments to demonstrate that entry into the bone marrow is competitive, and exploiting this fact, illustrate properties of T cells that are either relevant or irrelevant to long-term bone marrow colonization.",

Two weeks after immunization HBVc 128\u2013140 peptide-specific T cells could be found in the bone marrow, as well as in the spleen and lymph nodes (Fig. 1a). The HBVc 128\u2013140-specific IFN-\u03b3 response could be inhibited by adding the anti-I-Ab mAb AF6-120.1.2 to the culture medium during the 40-hr incubation (Fig. 1b).

Such rapid homing is mediated mostly by the interaction between the T cell VLA4 integrin and the bone marrow CD106 (also called VCAM1) adhesion molecule, with a minor role played by the CD11a/CD18 (LFA1) and its ICAM ligands.28,29 However, the potential contribution of CD11a/CD18, CD11b/CD18, or ICAM1 to interstitial migration and prolonged localization of T cells in the bone marrow has not been assessed. To this end, we performed a series of long-term migration experiments. First, we injected CFSE-labelled spleen and lymph node cells from B6 mice into age- and sex-matched recipients and analysed the distribution of donor T cells into spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow from 1 to 3 weeks later. By performing adoptive transfer into non-irradiated recipient mice, we tested the ability of donor T cells to displace the recipient T cells in each of the three organs. Figure 2(a) shows the typical gates for cell acquisition and flow cytometry analysis used in our experiments. One week after adoptive transfer, the percentage of donor T cells found in the lymph node T-cell pool was approximately the same as that found in the spleen, whereas that in the bone marrow was about one half of this (Fig. 2b). This same pattern of T-cell distribution persisted at 10 days (Fig. 2b), and up to 19 days after transfer (data not shown), and was highly reproducible from experiment to experiment (see Table 1, below). Moreover, similar findings were obtained when we injected donor cells by either the intravenous or intraperitoneal route (data not shown). These results indicate that bone marrow seeding by donor T cells is a controlled process that does not directly parallel colonization of secondary lymphoid organs.",

In a first set of experiments, we transferred ITGB2ko- or B6-derived cells into either ITGB2ko or B6 mice; in a second set, we transferred ICAM1ko- or B6-derived cells into either ICAM1ko or B6 mice. B6 transfers into B6 recipients were used as controls in each study. In total, we measured T-cell homing in eight experimental groups, each containing between six and 10 mice. As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 3, the donor T-cell percentage that localized to the bone marrow was about half of that found in the spleen, in all eight experimental groups. These findings mirrored those obtained with the combination of age- and sex-matched donor and recipient B6 mice (Fig. 2b). In contrast, ITGB2ko T cells had a significant disadvantage relative to B6 T cells in lymph node colonization compared to spleen colonization (ratio 0\u00b794, compared to 1\u00b747; Fig. 3a, Table 1), while B6 cell homing into lymph nodes in ICAM1ko recipient mice was likewise disadvantaged compared to that into the spleen (ratio 0\u00b787 compared to 1\u00b737; Fig. 3b, Table 1). These data are consistent with the roles reported for CD18 on T cells and ICAM1 on high endothelial cells in short-term lymph node homing.28 By contrast, although wild-type T cells had some disadvantage in entering the bone marrow compared to the spleen when transferred into ITGB2ko recipient mice, neither CD18 nor ICAM1 substantially affect bone marrow localization.",

As shown in Fig. 4(b), the transfer of memory-phenotype T cells, derived from the thymectomized old mice, to young mice produced a result strikingly different to that of other transfer experiments, in that there was preferential colonization of the bone marrow rather than the spleen (ratio 2\u00b700, compared to 0\u00b756 in young donor-young recipient controls). Conversely, virgin-phenotype T cells had a strongly impaired homing to the bone marrow with respect to the spleen in thymectomized old mice (ratio 0\u00b712, compared to 0\u00b756 in young donor\u2013young recipient controls). The reverse pattern was evident in the case of T-cell migration into lymph nodes, where T cells derived from young mice were advantaged over those in thymectomized old recipients, whereas T cells derived from thymectomized old mice were disadvantaged in young hosts. In sum, our results indicate that in a competitive setting, memory T cells have an advantage over virgin T cells in colonization of the bone marrow, whereas virgin T cells have an advantage over memory T cells in lodging into lymph nodes. This conclusion is supported by the finding that T cells derived from thymectomized old mice do not show improved bone marrow colonization in thymectomized old recipients, where existing memory-type T cells presumably preclude their free access. Likewise, T cells from young mice have no lymph node homing advantage when transferred to young mice.",

This finding, together with the observation that memory-phenotype T cells preferentially home to the bone marrow rather than to lymph nodes, suggest that bone marrow is an important site of memory T-cell trafficking and prolonged localization. Although activated T cells up-regulate LFA1 and can express Mac-1,3 our results demonstrate that these integrins are not involved in sustained memory T-cell lodging in the bone marrow, in agreement with previous short-term studies.28 The finding of memory-phenotype T cells in the bone marrow after adoptive transfer seemingly excludes the possibility that T-cell localization in the bone marrow is the result of the local presence of antigen. Moreover, because LFA1 and ICAM1 are not required for prolonged T-cell lodging into the bone marrow, it is unlikely that antigen presentation and APC\u2013T-cell interactions sustain T cells in the bone marrow \u2018niche\u2019.",

            "text": "The advantage shown by memory type cells over virgin cells in migration to the bone marrow bears obvious parallels with memory T-cell homing into extra-lymphoid organs. It is interesting that the interaction between VLA4 and VCAM1 is involved in effector/memory T-cell migration both to inflamed tissues and to bone marrow.29 T-cell homing into peripheral tissues has commonly been considered to be induced by inflammation, whereas migration of memory T cells to the bone marrow is considered to be a constitutive component of their recirculation within the lymphoid system. However, recent reports have shown high levels of constitutive memory T-cell lodging into extra-lymphoid organs in the absence of overt inflammation,31,32 and it has been demonstrated that epithelial cells produce homeostatic chemokines able to attract T lymphocytes at the body surfaces (reviewed in ref. 33). Building on this, an interesting model proposes that T lymphocytes traffic into extra-lymphoid organs through two main pathways with two distinct protective functions.33 The first, constitutive pathway regulates T-cell homing to skin and gut, large epithelial surfaces relentlessly exposed to pathogens and constitutively patrolled by T cells. The second pathway controls T-cell migration to internal organs, such as the kidney or liver, which are usually protected from pathogen attack and infiltrated by T cells only in the case of inflammation.33 In this context, we propose that memory T cells involved in the second pathway also recirculate through the bone marrow, and that this may be important for their long-term survival/proliferation, in a similar manner to the mechanisms reported for plasma cells.21,34\u201337",

Thus, it is unlikely that T cells migrate to the bone marrow only during a restricted time window after priming. In contrast, a conceivable scenario is that, among the T cells constantly circulating in the lymphoid periphery, those with memory phenotype preferentially migrate to the bone marrow. We speculate that these cells persist in the bone marrow for enough time to receive survival/proliferation signals which might be relevant for the maintenance of long-term memory. At least for memory CD8 T cells, IL-15 and IL-7 might provide these signals, as they are expressed at high levels in the bone marrow and have been involved in CD8 T-cell homeostasis.40 Most probably, the cells also return to the periphery from the bone marrow as they are displaced by other memory T cells competing for the same enclosed \u2018niche\u2019. Indeed, the clear impact of the recipient phenotype on the capability of cells to enter the bone marrow indicates that the bone marrow compartment for T cells is limited and saturable. In sum, our results support the idea that colonization of specific lymphoid environments is favoured by the expression of a memory phenotype and inhibited by the competition with other rival T cells.41\u201344 This implies that the homing potential of an individual lymphocyte is not merely an inherent property of the cell, but rather a property of the lymphoid system as a whole.",
