Empirical antibiotic therapy targeting bacteria commonly responsible for community-acquired pneumonia was an important diagnostic and therapeutic strategy, as non-SARS pneumonia generally responded to such therapy [4]. For patients who did not respond and in the presence of features consistent with SARS, a combination of corticosteroid and ribavirin therapy was given [4,11,12]. There is, however, considerable scepticism over the use of these drugs in SARS [13] and there is currently no consistently effective anti-SARS-CoV therapy.",

T cell-dependent cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), IL-2 and IL-4 will presumably be important for orchestrating the specific immune response and clearing the virus.

Thirteen patients satisfying the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) criteria for probable SARS [4,11,12] were studied (Table 1). All had an epidemiological link with other SARS patients; all but one had demonstrable SARS-CoV in nasopharyngeal aspirate, nasal and throat swabs, faeces, urine or sputum by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and all had documented anti-SARS-CoV IgG antibodies in serum. There were eight males and five females aged 25\u201363 (mean 42) years. All the patients were treated with a 10-day course of intravenous cefepime (2 g three times per day) and oral clarithromycin (500 mg twice per day). They also received ribavirin (8 mg/kg three times per day intravenously for 3 days followed by 1200 mg three times per day orally for a total of 10 days) and corticosteroids (intravenous hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone for 1\u201319 (mean 9) days starting 1\u20137 (mean 3) days after admission, followed by oral prednisolone for 30\u201363 (mean 51) days for patients with uneventful recovery). Daily doses of steroids are shown in Fig. 1. One SARS patient died of fulminant pneumonia 29 days after admission, another died of respiratory failure due to diffuse alveolar damage 63 days after admission and one was kept in intensive care until 58 days after admission. The other 10 patients were discharged from hospital after 25\u201333 days. There was underlying chronic disease in five patients (Table 1).",

Briefly, PBM were separated over Lymphoprep (Nycomed, Oslo, Norway) within 1 h of blood collection and added to 96-well multiscreen plates (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) which had been coated previously overnight at 4\u00b0C with cytokine capture antibodies (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) at 2 (IL-4, IL-10, IL-6), 4 (IL-12, TNF-\u03b1) or 8 (IFN-\u03b3, IL-2) \u00b5g/ml in 0\u00b71 m NaHCO3, pH 8\u00b72, and blocked with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) in culture medium RPMI-1640 for at least 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Duplicate cultures of 104 (for IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) or 105 (for IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-12) cells/well in RPMI + 5% FCS with or without stimulators (T cell activators phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) at a final concentration of 10 \u00b5g/ml or concanavalin A (Con A) at 20 \u00b5g/ml, or monocyte activator Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I, SAC, 0\u00b7001% v/v) were incubated for 22 h at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. Cells were then washed out with 0\u00b701 m phosphate-buffered saline containing 0\u00b705% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and plates incubated sequentially with biotinylated detection anticytokine antibodies (Pharmingen), 0\u00b75 \u00b5g/ml in PBS-T for 90 min, streptavidin\u2013alkaline phosphatase (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), 1/400 v/v in PBS-T for 60 min and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate-nitroblue tetrazolium (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA, USA) for 20 min, all at room temperature. Plates were washed extensively with PBS-T between each incubation and with saline to remove phosphate prior to addition of phosphatase substrate. Colour development was stopped and virus inactivated by immersion in 2% chlorox followed by rinsing under the tap and allowing plates to dry for 1 h. Blue spots corresponding to each cytokine-secreting cell were counted by microscopy and results expressed as ELISPOTS/106 PBM or ELISPOTS/106 T cells.",

This was not due entirely to suppression by high dose steroids, because four subjects tested before starting treatment also had deficiencies. Numbers of previously depressed ELISPOTS became normal in most patients by 20 weeks from first symptoms. Similar IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 and IL-4 profiles were obtained when results were adjusted according to the absolute T cell count in each patient for whom such results were available (Fig. 2). Very similar results were also obtained using Con A as stimulant (results not shown).",

We believed that measuring cytokine production by PBM in vitro could assist in achieving these goals. However, we were faced with the difficulty of identifying SARS-CoV-infected patients for study at an early stage of disease without fully validated rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently a number of patients with non-SARS community acquired pneumonia were tested inadvertently for cytokine production, to be excluded later when they recovered on antibiotic therapy. Because of the bacterial rather than viral nature of their infection, these patients did not constitute a valid control group, nor could a non-SARS viral pneumonia cohort be recruited because of the rarity of such patients in Hong Kong. It was therefore possible to evaluate only results for SARS patients in terms of our established laboratory normal ranges.",

Results must, however, be interpreted in conjunction with knowledge of the lymphocyte subset and monocyte content of the isolated PBM, because over or under representation of individual subsets will greatly influence the cytokine profile. It must also be appreciated that cytokines produced in vitro by PBM may not be fully representative of events in other organs of the body such as the lung and measurement of cytokines, soluble cytokine receptors and cytokine inhibitors in serum should be informative. Increased levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-13, IL-16, TNF-\u03b1 and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 [25] and of IL-10 [26] have been found in serum of SARS patients. The latter study also found increased IL-2 and IL-12 in serum, in contrast to our findings using ELISPOT.

IL-12 production following direct stimulation of monocytes was apparently disrupted to a greater extent by SARS-CoV and/or steroid treatment than that induced by PHA-activated T cells via CD40\u2013CD154 interaction [27], possibly because of higher levels of inhibitory IL-10 in SAC-stimulated cultures.
