After producing a list of sequence hits for the query alignment, we considered the families with known structures, finding a sequence with the best E-value in each of them. This best E-value was assigned to the PSI-BLAST comparison of the query alignment and the given family.

COMPASS hits that corresponded to higher PSI-BLAST E-values and thus passed the initial filtering were subjected to a more thorough analysis. From 518 such hits that did not include apparent transmembrane proteins, we chose ~100 COMPASS alignments of interest, which covered substantial protein regions and were not restricted to trivial similarities (e.g., P-loops). After this step, we further excluded the results that could be easily reproduced by running multiple iterations of PSI-BLAST against the NCBI nr sequence database, with various family members as queries, and the families that contained prokaryotic sequences assigned to a characterized COG (Tatusov et al. 1997, 2001). Sequences from the remaining PFAM alignments were submitted to the PHD server (Rost 1996; Przybylski and Rost 2002) for secondary structure predictions (with the option of iterated PSI-BLAST searches against SWISS-PROT, TrEMBL, and PDB databases). Using the available option of the PHD server, we also submitted PFAM alignments for the secondary structure prediction. Both PSI-BLAST and PFAM profiles produced similar PHD predictions. The sequences from the PFAM alignments were also submitted to the fold-recognition servers: 3D-PSSM (Kelley et al. 2000; version 2.6.0, using fold library 1.53.7660 and sequence database 2002.9.4) and bioinbgu (Fischer 2000; version as of September 2002). Iterated PSI-BLAST searches were performed in the NCBI nr database using the sequences from PFAM alignments as queries. The PSI-BLAST hits with E-values higher than the default cutoff were manually inspected. In cases in which the sequence length was <150 residues, it was submitted to the ROSETTA package for the ab initio prediction of protein structure (standalone version as of March 2002). To generate the input profile for ROSETTA, a PSI-BLAST search with the E-value cutoff of 0.001 was used; minimum sequence identity for inclusion in the profile was set to 25%; the PHD secondary structure prediction was used along with the profile to generate two sets of fragments of sizes 9 and 3; and the minimum allowed confidence for fragment prediction was set to 0.25. For each sequence, 2000 decoy structures (output in the PDB format) were generated and clustered by structure similarity. The decoys serving as the centers for the largest 10 clusters were examined.",

For any method involving automated sequence alignment, such a refinement increases the quality of the initial prediction by using data other than the sequence information, and by detailed manual assessment of these data. The refinement was based on the analysis of secondary structure elements, residue properties (hydrophobicity, charge, size, etc.), and conservation at the alignment positions, potential functionally and structurally important sites in the protein families. As shown previously (Sadreyev and Grishin 2003), the accuracy of the COMPASS alignments is higher than the accuracy of alignments produced by other tested automated methods for sequence\u2013profile or profile\u2013profile comparison. As shown in Figures 1 \u25b6\u20134 \u25b6, the manually refined alignments were in general similar to those initially produced by COMPASS. The main differences included slight local shifts of aligned positions and inclusion of longer profile regions after the manual analysis. Based on the resulting alignments, the tertiary structure of the families of interest was proposed.",

We submitted the pairs of interest and compared the resulting alignments and E-values to those by produced COMPASS.

The produced alignment reveals a remarkable conservation of this signature in the DUF185 family, including the invariant ligand-binding glutamate residues. In addition to the conserved signature pattern, the aligned regions have similar profiles of hydrophobicity and location of small residues. The secondary structure prediction for this part of DUF185 is consistent with the location of the known secondary structure elements in rRNA methylase (PDB ID 1yub; Fig. 2A,B \u25b6). The predicted secondary structure of the full-length DUF185 proteins (data not shown) comprises a pattern of consequent \u03b2\u2013\u03b1 units similar to the secondary structure arrangement of methylases. These similarities indicate that the DUF185 family possesses a Rossmann-like fold and may function as methylases.",

The alignment of this region proposed by ROSETTA was more biologically reasonable, because (1) it lined up the DUF128 regions with strong helical propensities (B and C) to the helices of the same length in the HTH protein; and (2) it located a structurally reasonable position of the functionally important turn between the two helices. Therefore, the ROSETTA alignment was used in the refinement of the initial COMPASS result. The alignment in the turn region, which comprises the functional DNA-binding site, was especially challenging, because in DUF128 this region presumably contains a two-residue insertion and is different from the typical turn in HTH proteins (Fig. 2A \u25b6, the site marked with the red line in the ROSETTA alignment).",

Viral_coat contains the S domain of the capsid proteins from plant icosahedral positive-strand RNA viruses (Dolja and Koonin 1991), the domain that forms the virion shell. COMPASS detected the similarity between this domain and the first of the three Astro_capsid proteins (Fig. 4 \u25b6). After the manual refinement, it was possible to extend COMPASS alignment to the full length of Viral_coat sequences (Fig. 4A \u25b6). The resulting multiple alignment reveals the significant similarity in the patterns of hydrophobicity and in the location of small residues over the whole length of the first Astro_capsid product and the Viral_coat domains. This similarity infers their homology and indicates that the first Astro_capsid protein possesses an all-\u03b2 structure similar to that of the S domain of the capsid proteins from plant icosahedral positive-strand RNA viruses.",

These similarities were assigned low E-values after a single COMPASS search in the set of 1354 PFAM alignments. However, they could not be automatically found by iterative PSI-BLAST searches with default parameters in the NCBI nr database. In several cases (DUF128, DUF185, and Astro_capsid families), the similarities found by COMPASS were also detected by another method for profile\u2013profile comparison, LAMA, which produced high Z-scores for ungapped alignments between short alignment blocks.

The predictions made by the fold-recognition (threading) servers (3D-PSSM and bioinbgu), which use versatile additional information (matching of secondary structure elements, propensities of the residues in the respect of solvent accesibility, etc.), were also generally in a good accord with COMPASS results. Finally, in the two cases in which the predicted protein regions were short enough to use ROSETTA, it produced the ab initio structural predictions that were strikingly similar to the proteins with known structure found by COMPASS. Although the presented similarities between the PFAM families could be predicted by other methods, the search by COMPASS was particularly well-fitted for this task, because this method uses only the minimal sequence information from the two compared alignments, and it makes the statistically significant predictions after a single search of the profile database.",

The scoring system implemented in COMPASS allows statistically significant alignments of short regions because it explicitly takes into account the effective counts of amino acids in the alignment columns rather than the residue frequencies alone. Thus, two alignment columns with similar amino acid frequency distributions will receive a higher matching score if they contain higher effective numbers of residues, because such a positive match is statistically more significant. In many cases (not shown), COMPASS reveals local structural similarities between the families, which are insufficient for homology prediction but represent important localized structural motifs, such as P-loops (Walker A), FAD/NAD binding motifs, Zn fingers, and so on. The evolutionary implications of such local structural similarities between different protein folds have been discussed, arguments being made for both convergent and divergent evolution (Fetrow and Godzik 1998; Copley et al. 2001; Lupas et al. 2001).",
