            "text": "Aminopeptidase N (EC 3.4.11.2) belongs to clan MA and family M1, which contain one zinc ion per molecule. The enzyme is well conserved in a variety of species, such as mammals, insects, plants and bacteria. Aminopeptidase N possesses broad substrate specificity and releases most N-terminal amino-acid residues. Together with certain endopeptidases, aminopeptidase N plays a predominant role in peptide degradation for utilizing amino acids as nutrients. Additionally, aminopeptidase N is known to possess significant physio\u00adlogical functions as a receptor without employing its enzymatic activity. For instance, human aminopeptidase N, which has been identified as a CD13 antigen, acts as a receptor for coronaviruses such as the transmissible gastroenteritis virus and human coronavirus 229E (Delmas et al., 1992 \u25b6; Curtis et al., 1992 \u25b6), while Bombyx mori aminopeptidase N serves as a receptor of Bacillus thuringensis Cry1Aa toxin (Yaoi et al., 1997 \u25b6). The Escherichia coli aminopeptidase N shares 13.6 and 13.4% sequence identity with its human and B. mori homologues and is an enzyme with a molecular weight of 99 kDa whose N-terminal order of preference is for Arg, Lys and Ala. The enzyme shows some activity for an N-terminal Pro residue, although the reaction is rather slow. This enzyme was first purified from E. coli K-\u00ad12 in 1982 and its catalytic properties were assessed using Ala-p-\u00adnitroanilide as a substrate (McCaman & Villarejo, 1982 \u25b6). The enzyme was reported to be a monomeric acidic protein containing at least one sulfhydryl group, essential for catalytic activity, which was readily inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate. Subsequently, the activity was also found to be inhibited by o-phenanthroline, puromycin, bestatin and amastatin. It has been also shown that the enzyme has aryl amidase and peptidase activities similar to those of aminopeptidase M from mammalian tissues (Yoshimoto et al., 1988 \u25b6). The nucleotide sequence of the pepN gene encoding aminopeptidase N of E. coli was sequenced and an open reading frame coding for a protein of 870 amino-acid residues was identified (Foglino et al., 1986 \u25b6). The aminopeptidase N contains a His297-Glu298-Xaa-Xaa-His301- (where Xaa is any amino-acid residue) sequence motif, which is a signature of a zinc-binding region. Despite the length of time since the discovery of aminopeptidase N, its three-dimensional structure has not yet been determined.",

The cells were suspended in 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer pH 7.0 and were disrupted by sonication in an ice bath using an Ultrasonic Disruptor (UD200, Tomy). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 22 540g for 20 min to remove cell debris. 2%(w/w) protamine sulfate was added to the supernatant in a dropwise fashion (to remove chromosomes and viscous material), resulting in 16 mg per gram of wet cells. After centrifugation at 22 540g, the supernatant was fractionated with ammonium sulfate from 35 to 70% saturation. The precipitate was dissolved in 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer pH 7.0 containing 35% saturated ammonium sulfate and the enzyme solution was applied onto a Toyopearl HW65C column equilibrated with the same solution. Enzymes were eluted with a linear gradient of ammonium sulfate concentration from 35 to 0% saturation. The enzyme was then purified in a DEAE-Toyopearl column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer pH 7.0 using a linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 M sodium chloride.

The crystallization condition that includes ammonium sulfate as a precipitant and which yielded reasonably diffracting crystals was optimized further using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method at 293 K. A 3 \u00b5l droplet of 28.0 mg ml\u22121 protein solution mixed with the same amount of reservoir solution was equilibrated against 500 \u00b5l reservoir solution (1.75 M ammonium sulfate and 100 mM MES buffer pH 6.4) to give good-quality crystals of aminopeptidase N.",
