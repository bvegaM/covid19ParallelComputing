After washing, sections were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled rabbit-anti-guinea pig Ig (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) for 1 hour at room temperature. HRP activity was revealed by incubating the sections in 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Sigma Chemical Co.) solution for 10 minutes, resulting in a red precipitate.

As in hMPV, incubation period and excretion period are short, although RSV excretion may be prolonged in infants and immunocompromised individuals.27 Both initial infection and subsequent shedding of RSV are restricted to ciliated epithelial cells, based on an in vitro study using recombinant RSV expressing green fluorescent protein.28 Similar to the localization of RSV in that study, the results of immunohistochemistry in these macaques show that hMPV infection is polarized to the apical surface of ciliated respiratory epithelium. In immunocompetent individuals, the most common clinical manifestation of RSV infection is mild upper respiratory tract disease.29 However, viral distribution and associated lesions of this mild disease have not been reported. In very young or immunocompromised individuals, RSV replication occurs in epithelial cells of bronchus, bronchiole, and in alveolar macrophages,30,31 and is associated with severe bronchiolitis, interstitial pneumonia, or giant cell pneumonia.32 Although clinical studies indicate that hMPV infection may cause similar lesions in this category of patients, confirmation of fatal bronchiolitis or pneumonia from hMPV infection awaits pathological assessment of biopsy or autopsy samples.18",
